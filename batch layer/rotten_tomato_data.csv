The Crucible,1914,80,"                      The story is one of gripping Interest, and in no photo drama in which she has appeared has Miss Clark's dramatic gift been shown to greater advantage.                  "
Damaged Goods,1914,86,"                      It is to be regretted that it is no better a piece of workmanship than it is, for in spite of its pictorial shortcomings, it will probably have a wide circulation and it might have been much more efficient in its purpose had it been more artistic.                  "
Carmen,1915,80,                      Frankly a mess.                  
Inspiration,1915,100,                      The picture is finely staged and contains many clever bits of photography. The cast is adequate.                  
The Iron Claw,1916,100,"                      [The Iron Claw] is proving very popular, and judging from the first episodes should unfold an interesting story. Many good artists are appearing, and the story is set amidst artistic surroundings.                  "
Romeo and Juliet,1916,100,"                      As a picture it was interesting, and would have furnished a splendid entertainment if one had never heard of Shakespeare.                  "
Shoes,1916,89,"                      The production rings true, and at no moment do the players appear to be acting.                  "
Cleopatra,1917,91,                      The film Cleopatra is another proof that the kinema may accomplish some of the effects of authentic dramatic art if it will only select its subjects judiciously.                  
Mutiny,1917,100,"                      It does not come mincingly forward draped in a cloak of righteousness, posing as a great moral lesson. Just seeps boldly forth decked with blood, thunder, cruel father, villain, true lover. and beleaguered heroine.                  "
Southern Justice,1917,71,"                      There is quite a bit of action toward the finish of the picture, and the pleasingly presented incidents, humorous and pathetic, throughout the story, maintain the interest and prevent dragginess.                  "
Arizona,1918,71,"                      The play has only one speed, and that's the third.                  "
Queen of the Sea,1918,80,"                      Aside from beautiful tinting and the undoubted aquatic prowess of Annette Kellermann, I'm afraid I shall have to class Queen of the Sea as rather poor entertainment.                  "
Deliverance,1919,88,"                      Miss Keller herself is a marvel of intuition and mechanical perfection, but I think the story, the human interest, is almost spoiled by the enormous amount of propaganda so unnecessarily inserted into the last reels.                  "
The Miracle Man,1919,95,                      There has been no more beautiful or fascinating play on the screen than is The Miracle Man. It is all entertainment.                  
Upstairs,1919,88,"                      Don't miss it if you want to see a really breezy, diverting fun film, with Mabel Normand at her very brilliant best.                  "
The Right of Way,1920,83,"                      A number of hugely interesting characters, are introduced, too, only to be dropped.                  "
Treasure Island,1920,82,"                      If you like the romance of pirates and hidden treasure, of old sailing vessels and lonely islands, you'll enjoy each moment of this presentation of Robert Louis Stevenson's tale.                  "
Disraeli,1921,100,"                      The remarkably finished performance of George Arliss, aided by Margaret Dale and a thoroughly competent cast, serves to bring out the dramatic elements in Louis Parker's play just about as effectively as they were brought out on the stage.                  "
The Great Moment,1921,67,                      The Great Moment is worth seeing for the engaging story and lively performances.                  
Jane Eyre,1921,80,"                      It will be appreciated most by admirers of the kind of entertainment that depends upon beauteous production, simplicity of narrative and wonderful photography, rather than thrills, surprises or spectacular effects.                  "
Destiny,1921,90,"                      It is one of three very remarkable German productions (the other two, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and The Street, will be released shortly) that are bound, sooner or later, to effect radical changes in the standards of film-making.                  "
Outside the Law,1920,100,"                      A good idea, well worked out, an decidedly well acted by Priscilla Dean, Wheeler Oakman and the ferocious Lon Chaney. We recommend the picture to those who share our own dime novel tastes.                  "
Clarence,1922,71,"                      Mr. Reid's expert interpretation of this character ought to silence those jealous males who have always said of him, scornfully, that he can't do anything but look pretty.                  "
Nanook of the North,1922,100,"                      Whether it’s for a film history course, or if you’re a film buff who’s working through cinematic milestones, Nanook is worth your time.                  "
Phantom,1922,43,"                      Far from some visual notes that at times add certain dreamlike qualities, I have the impression that it is a minor piece of Murnau's early expressionist cinema. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
Thirty Days,1922,33,"                      As a whole, it is a mediocre comedy which never arouses any great amount of interest and is only mildly amusing.                  "
The Enchanted Cottage,1924,86,"                      After her clever performance in that silly film Claudia, Dorothy McGuire gives a remarkable demonstration of her versatility as Laura.                  "
Merton of the Movies,1924,81,"                      James Cruze directed Merton of the Movies, and the briskness, snap and spontaneity which distinguish all his productions are evident throughout the picture.                  "
Michael,1924,94,"                      ...it holds its own not just through its stunning technical prowess, but also in its surprising cultural longevity.                  "
Three Women,1924,89,"                      Performance-wise, only Frederick manages a real and interesting turn here. She's fascinating to watch, and knows exactly how to play to the camera. Everyone else either overacts, mugs, or becomes part of the scenery.                  "
The Big Parade,1925,100,"                      A war picture so powerful, so well-balanced, so true to reality, or so lacking in exaggeration as The Big Parade... has not previously been shown in Auckland.                  "
Body and Soul,1925,86,"                      ""Body and Soul"" is not a small cinematic gem; it is a magnificent diamond.                   "
Master of the House,1925,100,"                      Dreyer's small-scale comedy, with its meticulous depiction of the thousand little chores of domestic order and occasional flashes of visual brilliance and startling symbolism, is nothing less than a child's muted cry of rage against the eternal elders.                  "
The Freshman,1925,94,"                      The predicaments aren’t too severe, depicted in a cartoonish manner, allowing for worthwhile skits with a dizzy tailor, a small baby, and an important dance - each providing mirth but failing to land major laughs.                  "
Graustark,1925,82,"                      Graustark is an old story, such as might be lifted from any of the better-class musical comedies, all newly furbished up with artistic direction and strong acting, so that one follows it with Interest, if not with enthusiasm.                  "
The Lady,1925,83,"                      A well-knit, fascinating drama.                  "
The Merry Widow,1925,100,                      This picture proves that Von Stroheim can direct also to the taste of the general public. The discriminating will find portions of it as gratifying to the palate as caviare and crusty old wine. The pee-pul will like it for a good show.                  
Aloma of the South Seas,1926,67,"                      To report candidly, this ""idyl of the South Seas"" falls considerably below greatness.                  "
Ben Hur A Tale of the Christ,1925,96,"                      Ramon Novarro, who plays the part of Ben-Hur, is a sturdy, handsome young chap, with an excellent figure. His performance is all that one could wish, for he is fervent and earnest throughout.                  "
Tartuffe,1925,88,"                      Tartuffe, thanks mainly to Emil Jannings' splendid performance, is a film to merit your considerate attention.                  "
What Price Glory,1926,100,"                      It rises above the appeals of patriotism, sentiment, humor, and romance -- although it has all those things -- to shake the whole emotional structure of spectators with an epic portrait of two fascinating and violent men.                  "
Berlin Symphony of a Great City,1927,86,"                      This is pure cinema, a work of visual rapture that often feels like stepping into a time machine, inviting us into a world long since past.                  "
Camille,1926,40,"                      Mr. Niblo has concentrated on the scenes as he visualized them rather than on the nature of the characters. He has sacrificed his story for lengthy close-ups, and other interruptions. You obtain little conception of the character of Camille.                  "
The Shepherd of the Hills,1928,63,"                      The types from the Shepherd of Alec Francis to the Sammy Lane of Molly O'Day are played sincerely, yet the total result is somewhat slow.                  "
The Cameraman,1928,100,                      ...registers as a strung-together package of exceedingly clever Keaton shorts.                  
Gentlemen Prefer Blondes,1928,80,"                      It manages to miss the main point of Anita Loos's original manuscript, and if you ask me what that point is, I shall have to break down and confess that I don't just know.                  "
The Man Who Laughs,1928,100,"                      Leni edify the gothic melodrama with a somber aesthetic that elevates each fragment of the frame through which Conrad Veidt walks to laugh and that demonstrates, above all, his expertise as a craftsman of German expressionism. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
My Man,1928,86,"                      It is all, however, singularly low-brow, relieved by Miss Brice's own melodies and recitations.                  "
The Racket,1928,100,"                      Mr. Meighan, who has recently been counted out as a popular star, gives what is easily the best performance of his career.                  "
Tenderloin,1928,25,"                      Talking movies won't be an accomplished fact until there is some assurance that the movies know what to say. In the meantime, little films should be seen and not heard.                  "
The Way of All Flesh,1927,88,"                      Jannings is incomparably the greatest of all screen actors, unless it be that the aforesaid Charles Spencer Chaplin can tie him.                  "
Arsenal,1929,83,"                      The picture as a whole is an amazing performance, no less rich in its technical resourcefulness than in its dramatic sense of human character; and it is splendidly acted.                  "
The Great Gabbo,1929,71,"                      James Cruze is efficient in his direction of The Great Gabbo, which is no small feat considering the difficulties of shooting with the early sound cameras.                  "
Hallelujah,1929,86,"                      Great cinematographic events like Hallelujah are thus always the fruit of great sociological events. Indeed, this film is an eternal testament that transcends both its author-director and the history of cinema itself.                  "
Spite Marriage,1929,100,                      There's still enough inspired joy in this old film to make most current comedies look feebly unoriginal.                  
Thunderbolt,1929,70,                      Thunderbolt was Josef von Sternberg's first talkie (a silent version was also produced) and nabbed George Bancroft his only Best Actor Oscar nomination.                  
The Big House,1930,75,"                      Dialogue cannot carry the mood, the film as a whole is the vehicle. The accusations therefore remain incidents -- passing and unemphatic. Whatever suggestion of social guilt they contain is dissipated by the events of the story, and their treatment.                  "
The Blue Angel,1930,96,                      The Blue Angel launched a legendary collaboration between Josef von Sternberg and Marlene Dietrich in Hollywood.                  
The Divorcee,1930,75,"                      A movie about, essentially, the perils of revenge sex (for women, at least).                  "
Kismet,1930,85,"                      The dialogue is competently handled, so that, while the spectacular episodes are eye-filling, the story always holds one's attention. There are huge settings of the palace and the dungeons, the size of which enhances the value of the action.                  "
Little Caesar,1931,92,                      The cast is well chosen for a movie of the class.  [Full review in Spanish]                   
Westfront 1918,1930,100,"                      When the history of the cinema comes to be written, it is probable that Westfront 1918, directed by Pabst, will occupy the same position with regard to the sound film that Potemkin occupies in relationship to the silent picture.                  "
Daughter of the Dragon,1931,71,"                      For those who are attuned to this type of spectacle, this will be very entertaining. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
Huckleberry Finn,1931,83,"                      It is an offering which will be heartily welcomed, in spite of changes due to the demands of the screen, by all admirers of the great [Mark Twain].                  "
Comradeship,1931,90,"                      The scenes of the catastrophe and rescue which take up two thirds of the action, are full of the most complicated, subtle and effective shots ever made in a German studio.                  "
Private Lives,1931,80,"                      An early talkie attempt at glittering theatrical sophistication-and, somehow, in its own terms, it works.                  "
Safe in Hell,1931,100,                      Safe in Hell is a splendid picture!                  
The Crowd Roars,1932,83,                      ...a comfortably familiar premise that's employed to mostly watchable (if rather forgettable) effect by Hawks.                  
Ecstasy,1933,54,"                      Experimentally it was a dud. It was a bad motion picture --slow, poorly played, pretentiously arty and uncommonly dull, for all of the hullabaloo it caused.                  "
Freaks,1932,95,"                      While Freaks might not be perfect, its respect and empathy for such a marginalized group so early on is absolutely worth noting.                  "
I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang,1932,96,                      Its material of social denouncement about the injustices of the penal system is powerful and moving to me due to the caliber performance of Paul Muni. [Full review in Spanish]                  
Rasputin and the Empress,1932,50,"                      This sort of historical perversion, in the films and elsewhere, is not new; and the only point worth noting about the present instance is that the artistic result hardly seems worth the assassination of fact.                  "
Tarzan the Ape Man,1932,100,"                      Sticking to one of the primary themes of Burroughs’ series, it’s eventually evident that man is more barbarous and cruel than the untamed beasts merely surviving in the wild.                  "
Baby Face,1933,100,                      Stanwyck's Lily flips gender and power dynamics on their heads.                  
Dancing Lady,1933,80,                      Elaborate screen revue in which Joan Crawford re-establishes herself as America's dancing daughter.                  
Footlight Parade,1933,100,                      The film will have interest for admirers of James Cagney. He surprisingly reveals gifts as a singer and tap-dancer.                  
42nd Street,1933,96,"                      It's the cast, the banter and the backstage at-a-musical-revue-in-rehearsal milieu that keep this picture fresh.                  "
Gold Diggers of 1933,1933,100,"                      Capture(s) Hollywood decadence combined with Depression-era resentment of the elites and mistrust of the Washington establishment with grand, dreamlike relish.                  "
King Kong,1933,96,"                      King Kong is one of the most original, thrilling and mammoth novelties to emerge from a movie studio. A great show! But don't take nervous children to see it.                  "
Little Women,1933,89,"                      [Little Women is] improved by its superbly beautiful screen translation, because the rich character and depth possessed by the story have been freed from the somewhat saccharine sentimentality which overlaid them in the book.                  "
Queen Christina,1933,83,"                      Beyond the ridiculousness of certain situations, of their primitive and naïve character... the film does radiate lost nobility and elegance, a simplicity that can suddenly and naturally achieve greatness.                  "
The Story of Temple Drake,1933,86,"                      The film, directed by Stephen Roberts, is a progressive provocation riding solely on its considerable shock value as well as a signature role for actress Miriam Hopkins.                  "
Anne of Green Gables,1934,83,                      Casting generally has met with the happiest success.                  
March of the Wooden Soldiers,1934,100,"                      It's a combination of Victor Herbert, scrambled Mother Goose, scrambled Laurel and Hardy, and toy nightmare - the sort of thing an imaginative child might dream, falling asleep after too many Christmas excitements and indigestibles.                  "
The Man Who Knew Too Much,1934,89,"                      The acting is for the most part simple and straightforward, but there is real subtlety in the performance of Peter Lorre, the Dusseldorf murderer of M, as the anarchist leader.                  "
Maniac,1934,89,"                      A truly wretched film that I enjoyed, partly because of and partly in spite of its excessive excrescence.                  "
The Merry Widow,1934,82,"                      A perfect realization of a director's dream. And when the director is Ernst Lubitsch, the picture rates very high...                  "
Nana,1934,71,"                      The picture is stodgy, pretentious, and utterly without the Zola verve. One can't quite decide about Anna. Maybe it was the wrong picture, or maybe she really can't act.                  "
The Thin Man,1934,98,                      The Thin Man remains an unparalleled mixture of laughs and suspense that many have imitated but none have equaled.                  
White Heat,1934,40,"                      There are many spots where the film looks like the Infant talkies back in 1929, and the acting is generally amateurish. Despite its crudity, movie fans on Kauai will : undoubtedly want to see it.                  "
Alice Adams,1935,94,"                      This all attempts to be folksy comedy, but very often falls into savage satire.                  "
Anna Karenina,1935,93,"                      With such a brief running time, it's difficult to create a convincing union - both during the moments of bliss and quarreling, which are equally rushed.                  "
Bordertown,1935,100,"                      [Muni's] performance, on the whole, is a typical Muni performance -- being vigorous, simple, unaffected and believable. He is one of those rare actors whose talents don't seem to be thrown pell-mell into the very teeth of the camera.                  "
Broadway Melody of 1936,1935,89,"                      The whole of Melody is deft, and some of the specialties, such as Dr. Wildhack's snoring numbers, are tops.                  "
Captain Blood,1935,100,"                      It reminds us why Warner Bros. was the studio for action, why Errol Flynn became their greatest action star, and why De Havilland was so respected.                  "
China Seas,1935,80,"                      China Seas is as stirring a melodrama as you are likely to come across during the current movie season, one violent climax leading into another and frequently overlapping it.                  "

Around the World in 80 Days,1956,70,"                      Around the World in Eighty Days is like a serial; a serial in brilliant Technicolor and a system by now called, I believe, Cinestage, ending in the most ingenious credits I have ever seen. It is a journey through scenes where the sun is aways shining.                  "
Attack,1956,100,                      Such relative reservations on my part cannot prevail against the intellectual and formal beauties of Robert Aldrich's admirable -- and therefore eminently defensible -- film.                  
Baby Doll,1956,83,"                      With a bit more directorial restraint, the film could have been a classic -- as is, the uniformly excellent performances make it a case history of four strange persons.                  "
The Bad Seed,1956,63,                      [The Bad Seed] is a double-decked rouser -- a sock melodrama and an absorbing study in crime.                  
Bhowani Junction,1956,100,"                      ... a Hollywood drama with an old-fashioned sense of storytelling and a modern (for the time) approach to colonialism, bigotry and identity.                  "
The Catered Affair,1956,17,"                      Overall, the performances are good and there are occasionally amusing and touching momemts in the otherwise talky, mostly drab, affair under Richard Brooks' direction.                  "
Forbidden Planet,1956,96,                      One of the great and iconic science fiction films of all time.                  
Giant,1956,88,"                      Overlong as Giant may be, one cannot but admire the authority and skill with which George Stevens, the coproducer-director, masters the narrative rolling stock in his tremendous train of events... this is film making of a very high order.                  "
High Society,1956,82,                      sparkling fresh and brilliant entertainment                  
Lust for Life,1956,86,                      ...here it feels more than right to leave that work to Douglas. And it's precisely that kind of measure and reserve that makes Minnelli a realist artist himself — albeit a realist of a different kind.                  
The Man Who Knew Too Much,1956,87,"                      Let us love Hitchcock when, weary of passing simply for a master of taut style, he takes us the longest way round.                  "
Tea and Sympathy,1956,82,"                      For the most part, [Minnelli's] touch is delicate and contemplative; it is to his credit that the full integrity of the acting endures, and that not all of the themes that might have made the filming of Tea and Sympathy prohibitive have been sacrificed.                  "
War and Peace,1956,50,"                      ... the film is quite decent (although the script is fairly facile), mostly because the focus is largely on Natasha, and Hepburn brings a grace but also a sexiness to the role that she hadn't yet shown - especially with her scenes with Vittorio Gassman.                  "
While the City Sleeps,1956,90,"                      Even when he is reduced to working with scant means or idiotic stories, Lang can create something of substance.                  "
Band of Angels,1957,40,                      A failed film.                  
Cast a Dark Shadow,1955,83,"                      The narrative drags a bit in the middle, but Bogarde is always on hand to inject some nasty energy                  "
Designing Woman,1957,82,"                      The uproarious ""ravioli scene"" is the movie's most famous interlude (Peck tribute shows often would employ it to demonstrate the actor's underrated comic chops), but there are plenty of memorable set-pieces in this effervescent effort.                  "
Jailhouse Rock,1957,81,                      Jailhouse Rock features Elvis Presley at his finest.                  
Kanal,1957,100,"                      Thus calmly and deliberately, I state: Wajda stands beside Luis Bunuel and Ingmar Bergman. He is in the line that goes from Louis Feuillade to Frank Borzage, and from Jean Vigo to Georges Franju.                  "
Les Girls,1957,89,"                      Undistinguished Cole Porter score and lack of one brilliant, show-stopping dance number handicaps film, and keeps it well below standard of Singing in the Rain and The Bandwagon.                   "
The Cranes Are Flying,1957,96,"                      What makes “The Cranes Are Flying” so unforgettable is the visual splendor of its cinematography. The fluid camera movement is simply put, astounding.                  "
Love in the Afternoon,1957,82,                      Love in the Afternoon deserves credit for its artistic merit but also for serving as the beginning of a beautiful affair between Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond.                  
The Devil Strikes at Night,1957,88,"                      Interesting twists and subtleties in politics, psychology and a special time and place, make this most unusual.                  "
Saint Joan,1957,25,"                      A sentimental, slow, incompetent presentation of G.B.S.                   "
Silk Stockings,1957,100,"                      The picture effectively marked Fred Astaire's retirement from dancing -- it was his last significant on-screen hoofing, and he's as sublime as ever. Yet it's co-star Cyd Charisse who dominates the picture.                  "
The Magician,1958,100,"                      It is, quite literally at times, a romp.                  "
Auntie Mame,1958,88,"                      The story keeps shifting around from place to place and event to event, appearing as if the plot is made up on the spot; the film feels comprised of an improvisational, unorthodox series of vignettes.                  "
Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,1958,97,"                      Brimming with Southern personality, big but fitting performances, and a script with a bite, “Cat on a Hot Tin Roof” is as mesmerizing today as it was over 50 years ago.                  "
Gigi,1958,88,"                      Most of Gigi is in the Hollywood “big production"" style at its most handsome and vivacious -- expensive froth carbonated by experts.                  "
House on Haunted Hill,1959,78,                      One of William Castle’s best gimmicky film... with a delicious performance by Vincent Price.                  
The Left Handed Gun,1958,92,                      A lively and influential psychological Western.                  
The Lineup,1958,86,"                      Cinematographer Hal Mohr made the best of his locations, more than once pausing the story so the film can drink in its characters being dwarfed by their surroundings...                  "
No Time for Sergeants,1958,60,                      Mr. Griffith made his name in this role and after watching him for five minutes it is easy to see why.                  
The Reluctant Debutante,1958,50,                      A comedy with bursts of inspired lunacy.                  
Tom Thumb,1958,100,                      A celebrated fairy-tale by the Brothers Grimm has been turned into a movie that should delight most youngsters without unduly boring their elders.                  
Ben Hur,1959,85,"                      [The filmmakers] can't give it an imaginative size to match its physical size... Nevertheless if we must have films of this kind, this is the one to have.                   "
The Bridge,1959,100,"                      Filmed in striking black and white, it's a successfully sympathetic narrative concerning a group of teenage boys drafted into a useless battle at the tail end of WWII.                  "
The Crimson Kimono,1959,80,"                      Promoted upon its original release with such lurid and misleading lines like, ""Yes, this is a beautiful American girl in the arms of a Japanese boy! What was his strange appeal for American girls?"" this is actually a thoughtful drama.                  "
Day of the Outlaw,1959,100,"                      Day of the Outlaw has the stark all-encompassing quality of a late, fully developed style...                  "
The Indian Tomb,1959,88,"                      European exceptionalism is the rule here, with whites being unquestionably good and Indians with European blood or with European educations blatantly portrayed as more civilized.                  "
The Mummy,1959,91,                      It’s really Lee’s performance which gives the film its soul.                  
Pickpocket,1959,93,"                      The style of the film is characteristic of the director... But this time the method defeats itself. In rejecting every irrelevant action, in ruthlessly refining away every decoration, Bresson has thrown away the motives as well.                   "
Rio Bravo,1959,98,"                      The glue of the film may be the supporting performances. There is no way “Rio Bravo” would be as good if not for Dean Martin, Ricky Nelson, and Angie Dickinson.                  "
A Summer Place,1959,83,"                      The movie is so-so, BUT that great theme music!                  "
Floating Weeds,1959,96,                      I know very few lovers of cinema who don't embrace Ozu.                  
Eyes Without a Face,1960,96,"                      Eyes Without a Face remains such an enduring classic because of its rich signification - its horror employs thematically haunted and evocative symbols of eyes, faces, and masks.                   "
Breathless,1960,96,"                      Godard is constantly calling attention to the artifice and reminding you that you’re watching a movie. Much like its protagonist, 'Breathless' can't stop looking at itself in the mirror.                  "
BUtterfield 8,1960,47,"                      Elizabeth Taylor's Oscar-winning performance as an up-market whore with a heart is the chief, if not only, interest of this otherwise weak and dated drama.                  "
The Battle of Austerlitz,1960,40,"                      The film has all the hallmarks of a great big bore (even in this heavily cut version, the first hair does seem pretty interminable); and yet the personality of its creator is there all the time, mixing dross with gold as he has always done.                  "
Hell to Eternity,1960,83,"                      The film is handled with a fair amount of sensitivity, which frequently saves it from going overboard and the cast Is a capable one, led by Jeff Hunter. However, the picture is almost stolen by an appealing, elderly woman, playing mama Une.                  "
Home from the Hill,1960,90,"                      A rich family drama anchored by Robert Mitchum's fine performance and further distinguished by superlative support, by George (two of them, actually).                  "
The Last Voyage,1960,60,                      Suspense is spun out almost to the edge of audience hysteria in this terror-at-sea thriller.                  
The Millionairess,1960,20,                      One of the least memorable of Bernard Shaw's plays has been turned into a handsome but oddly sluggish film under the direction of Anthony Asquith...                  
Mughal E Azam,1960,92,"                      A father-son saga writ large through opulent sets, operatic performances and spellbinding cinematography, Mughal-e-Azam is a feast for the senses.                  "
Peeping Tom,1960,95,                      A feverish cult object among horror acolytes and classic film buffs alike.                   
Sunrise at Campobello,1960,88,"                      Franklin D. Roosevelt's valiant, cheerful battle against polio and despair at his summer home in New Brunswick in the early 1920s has been turned into a stirring and entertaining film.                  "
The Time Machine,1960,76,"                      It has the epic feel that you need, and it hasn't quite gotten to the goofiness of the 60s yet... It's authentic, and I think it strives to be like the book.                  "
The Bad Sleep Well,1960,100,"                      Kurosawa constructs a Shakespearean revenge plot that illustrates, with much pathos, an argument about corporate corruption in postwar Japanese society, with a compelling and restrained performance by Toshiro Mifune. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
The Wasp Woman,1959,45,                      From the perspective of a 21st Century ... The Wasp Woman is a downright revolutionary act of scathing commentary.                  
Where the Boys Are,1960,88,"                      The slang is even more outdated than the sexual politics, but all of the performers shine with colorful characterizations, particularly Hart, Prentiss, and Gorshin.                  "
The Exiles,1961,89,"                      As much an impressionistic gallery of urban landscapes as a set of candid portraits, the film joins an ardent sense of place with the subtle flux of inner life.                  "
Lola,1961,94,"                      Quick cuts, lingering moments, shadow cast walls, expert mirroring, nearly every window used as a source of light. It's hard not to fall in love with Lola...                  "
Something Wild,1961,50,"                      Something Wild lives up to its name, a psychologically ambitious creature unable to conform to the sensibilities of the period in which it was made.                  "
Victim,1961,100,"                      It is outspoken -- but honestly so, not cheaply designed to merely shock its audience.                  "
All Fall Down,1962,40,                      A flashy but contrived Hollywood melodrama...                  
The Grim Reaper,1962,86,"                      Bernardo Bertolucci the poet, declaring a change of medium                  "
The Day of the Triffids,1963,77,"                      It's a good siege narrative, with uneven but sometimes very effective effects.                  "
Days of Wine and Roses,1962,100,                      ...the meandering (and sporadically repetitious) narrative prevents the viewer from wholeheartedly connecting to the central characters' progressively downbeat plight...                  
Eegah,1962,0,                      The first draft nature of the screenplay is betrayed by its repetition.                  
Freud,1962,78,"                      ...a film of considerable artistic and intellectual merit, and deserves recognition as something other than a production nightmare.                  "
Harakiri,1962,100,                      Masaki Kobayashi’s “Harakiri” illustrates the samurai code as a flawed system hiding behind a façade of honor and principle—it is undeniably the greatest anti-samurai film ever made.                   
Ride the High Country,1962,89,                      Peckinpah was always more of a romantic than most people realized and with 'Ride the High Country' he delivered a lovely western and an American classic.                  
An Autumn Afternoon,1962,95,                      This close relationship between father and daughter faced with an inevitable departure makes for some finely understated melancholy undercurrents.                  
America America,1963,67,"                      In his unswerving insistence upon America as Redeemer, Kazan has made a kind of miracle play.                  "
The Cardinal,1963,50,"                      The scenery is superb, the acting good: yet The Cardinal suggests neither the crises of the period, nor the anguished religious struggles it seeks to portray within the Catholic soul. Though the treatment is reverential, it lacks spiritual fiber.                  "
Flipper,1963,50,"                      If you like animal movies, filmed and narrated in an entertaining and educational way, you can't help but like Ivan Tors' newest entry to the family movie circle, Flipper.                  "
4 for Texas,1963,11,"                      Aldrich's trademark violence bursts through only sporadically; otherwise the film comes across as a lazy, party-time effort for the stars.                  "
The Leopard,1963,98,                      Visconti's epic is a work of astonishing proportions. The breadth and depth of his treatment of the subject matter is on a scale almost unimaginable in recent cinema.                  
The Haunting,1963,87,"                      Dripping with queer subtext, this 1963 adaptation of Shirley Jackson’s The Haunting of Hill House is a master class in reading between the lines.                  "
The Leather Boys,1964,77,"                      What the film gets spot on is milieu. Its London streets are monotonous brick barracks. The houses reek of boiled potatoes, unwashed curtains, endless resentment. What hungry soul wouldn't want to flee? Or hear the engines of motorbikes as siren calls?                  "
Lord of the Flies,1963,91,"                      Too slow in the establishing shots and too flurried with action shots, the direction, like the tediously repetitive score, raises a barrier between us and the subject.                  "
Muriel,1963,85,                      An absorbing and beautiful film.                  
Contempt,1963,92,                      ... [an] unlikely meeting between Godard’s anti-Hollywood sensibility and the showman aesthetic of (uncredited) producer Joseph E. Levine in an international co-production about the clash between art and commerce...                  
Nine Hours to Rama,1963,80,                      Chillingly fascinating.                  
Paranoiac,1963,80,"                      One of the roughly 2,648 films from the decade that was influenced by the massive success of Hitchcock's 1960 Psycho. This one's pretty good.                  "
The Prize,1963,50,"                      Criticism retreats, disarmed, before a film which hardly even allows itself to become serious about the Nobel prize.                  "
Sunday in New York,1963,100,                      A film that's utterly charming in its presentation if hopelessly dated in its sexual politics.                  
Under the Yum Yum Tree,1963,17,"                      As engineered by director David Swift, the film's cardinal error is its lack of restraint.                  "
Cheyenne Autumn,1964,60,"                      James R. Webb's screenplay, Ford's direction and the splendid acting of the cast make this an impressive film.                  "
Red Desert,1964,97,                      Monica Vitti renders a stupendous interpretation of a misunderstood and delirious wife lost in a social environment... [Full review in Spanish]                  
A Distant Trumpet,1964,50,                      It takes a heap of loafing to make a Western film so dull you even lose interest in watching the horses and the stunt men doing their stuff.                  
The Incredible Mr Limpet,1964,40,"                      You know, for kids! Best to repeat that mantra-style if you’re an adult sitting down to watch 1964’s kiddie flick The Incredible Mr. Limpet. [Blu-ray]                  "
The Naked Kiss,1964,93,"                      A white-knuckle ride into a world of lies, deceit and small town politics.                  "
The Umbrellas of Cherbourg,1964,97,"                      It is all so sweet, so sentimental, so artsy, so craftsy, so pretty, so pretentious, so abysmally simple-minded.                  "
The Patsy,1964,82,"                      ...it makes people watching it break things, the way his handlers drop cups and overturn bottles watching him in disbelief at his one-of-a-kind incompetence.                  "
Battle of the Bulge,1965,63,"                      Yes “Battle of the Bulge” is long and sometimes talky. No it’s not a movie to watch in order to learn the real details of this historical and important battle. But in terms of cinematic entertainment, the movie works.                  "
Le Bonheur,1965,80,"                      Le Bonheur is a masterpiece. With one of the strongest screenplays and visual styles of all time, the film effortlessly is able to find a nuanced look at the human condition that has never been captured with the same power either before or after.                  "
Chimes at Midnight,1965,96,                      Most are advised that watching the movie feels more like homework than entertainment.                  
The Collector,1965,100,"                      It is Stamp who raises The Collector to heights of parable, who brings significance to and sustains the suspense. His performance is brilliant in its gauge of the madness of a madman.                  "
Inside Daisy Clover,1965,31,"                      It’s short on characters, detail, activity, dialogue, even music; it’s so determined to be stylish and knowing that, rather than risk banality, it eliminates almost everything.                  "
Life at the Top,1965,20,                      A lacklustre sequel to Room at the Top.                  
Lord Jim,1965,57,"                      At best, it only resembles Conrad's 1900 novel.                  "
A Patch of Blue,1965,89,                      A modest effort only barely protoplastic.                  
Time to Die,1966,100,                      Regrets and redemption come to a significant impasse in this beautifully realized first feature.                  
Two on a Guillotine,1965,0,"                      Inspired title, uninspired movie.                  "
Blow Up,1966,87,"                      Italian New Wave director Michelangelo Antonioni was helping alter the European cinematic landscape with his bold features. One of Antonioni’s classics is the great “Blow-Up,” which is from 1966 and is one of my all-time favorite movies.                   "
The Glass Bottom Boat,1966,57,"                      This takes an awfully long time to hit its comic stride, although the film finally delivers the goods during the second half.                  "
Grand Prix,1966,100,"                      It's a rowdy, roaring, ecstatic hallelujah of movement and speed.                  "
Judith,1966,20,"                      Shot in Israel and acted by an international cast, the movie still has made-in-Hollywood stamped all over it.                  "
Madame X,1966,60,"                      Madame X is an emotional Grand Guignol, a hysterical soap opera that would end up being the final and potentially most memorable hour of Lana Turner.                  "
Daisies,1966,86,"                      With its recent 4k restoration, ""Daisies"" endures as a New Wave masterpiece and hyper-feminine smorgasbord of sensory pleasure.                  "
Spinout,1966,40, 
Bonnie and Clyde,1967,89,"                      While the supporting cast is great, the cinematography is amazing, and the bluegrass score sets a perfect tone, it’s the two leads who anchor the film.                  "
Cool Hand Luke,1967,100,"                      In my mind, the most defining role of Paul Newman's long, illustrious career, and one of the great antihero films told with cruel wit - a black comedy if ever there was one.                  "
Corruption,1968,67,"                      The concept of face -- as a noun, as a verb, as the mask that hides and exposes our emotions, as the anchor to our definition of self -- is so essential to human identity that horror films that hinge on the disfigurement of the face have a special power.                  "
The Incident,1967,88,"                      The sort of raw drama that, sad to say, never loses its topicality.                  "
The Jungle Book,1967,88,"                      This may not be Kipling’s The Jungle Book, but Walt Disney’s The Jungle Book is still a classic in its own right.                  "
Son of Godzilla,1967,60,"                      A lot of fans detest Minilla (it's pronounced ""Min-Yah"") but I always liked him.                  "
Mouchette,1967,88,                      Disturbing and heart-rending.                  
A Man Vanishes,1967,100,                      Messy experimental pic that starts out as a documentary but changes to fiction.                  
Point Blank,1967,92,"                      Walker isn't particularly likable, but his frantic grasps at purpose are far more meaningful than your typical revenge fare. A definitive entry in the genre.                  "
Portrait of Jason,1967,100,"                      Clark's film often frames Jason out of focus, just out of reach, a fascinating enigma seen through the haze of celluloid, a lie at 24 frames per second.                  "
Up the Down Staircase,1967,78,"                      Up the Down Staircase is one of those rare films in which all the important talents mesh to form a wonderfully coherent, humane and sensitive vision of an aspect of our reality.                  "
Wait Until Dark,1967,96,"                      It starts slowly but gathers pace with a compelling momentum that builds to a climax of great tension. Fine entertainment, but if you have a nervous disposition, keep away.                   "
Warrendale,1967,100,                      A very nearly perfect documentary.                  
The Way West,1967,33,"                      Kirk Douglas, Robert Mitchum, and Richard Widmark help to oil the squeaky theme with their skill.                  "
2001 A Space Odyssey,1968,92,"                      Rather than pursuing the elusive significance behind the images in the film, experience them the way Kubrick intended and devise your own understanding.                   "
Les Biches,1968,77,"                      It passes over us with the full weight of its two hours. Les Biches is a sleeper, that is, it's soporific.                  "
Bullitt,1968,98,"                      Fifty years later and the closest anyone has ever come to this is simply stealing plot points here, an action beat there, and wishing that their leading man was a tenth as cool as Steve McQueen.                  "
Bye Bye Braverman,1968,33,"                      Despite the importance of verbal comedy to the whole conception, the dialogue is often wrecked by clumsy, imprecise readings, and though the sound is in sync, the voices seem disembodied.                  "
The Young Girls of Rochefort,1967,98,                      It bypasses the more intimate style of The Umbrellas of Cherbourg to pay homage to splashy Hollywood musicals.                  
The Great Silence,1968,100,"                      The Great Silence is, quite simply, one of the best Spaghetti Westerns ever made                  "
Ice Station Zebra,1968,47,                      Buy some popcorn and see the movie.                  
The Queen,1968,96,"                      The Queen is an important film not only because of it’s study of the drag queen, but because, simply, it is a very good film.                   "
Romeo and Juliet,1968,95,"                      Writer-director Franco Zeffirelli does some major surgery on the fabric of Shakespeare’s drama and finds a vibrant, surging, full-blooded new life beneath.                  "
Sebastian,1968,29,"                      It’s a trivial little movie, a London-set comedy-thriller about espionage and code-breakers, with not much in the way of comedy and less in the way of thrills. It’s just classy pulp, but the whole thing goes by before one has time to begin to hate it.                  "
The Cremator,1969,88,"                      While retrospect allows one to appreciate The Cremator's comically monstrous undertones, it's dismaying sense of dread has only become more potent over time.                  "
The Two of Us,1967,94,"                      There’s so little going on in The Two of Us that one has to begin thinking of it as an idyll-fable, which has never been my idea of a good time.                  "
Wild in the Streets,1968,67,                      It is nothing substantial and everything urgent.                  
Bronco Bullfrog,1970,100,"                      Somehow their lack of operatics, and the movie's refusal to conform to a cautionary crime movie template -- or any kind of template, really -- gives these young people a comic dignity.                  "
The Damned,1969,88,"                      Tracing the downfall of the von Essenbecks, a family of steel magnates now manufacturing and selling weapons to the Nazis, director Luchino Visconti uses The Damned to document the profligacy and debauchery that set the stage for Hitler’s rise.                    "
Le Grand Amour,1969,100,"                      Director and co-writer Etaix does a fine, funny job in his commentary on modern marriage (at least, marriage in late 1960s France) and infidelity and the damaging power of gossip.                  "
The Phantom Tollbooth,1970,100,"                      The most satisfying post-revel feeling is in the realization that there are still those who care not only about fantasy and adventure but also about courage and ingenuity and, even more important, literacy and imagination.                  "
Porcile,1969,56,"                      Nothing in Pigsty is delivered to the viewer, the vast majority of the film requiring interpretation, other than a powerful final scene that leaves us in no doubt as to Pasolini's opinions on the hypocrisy of a bourgeoisie.                  "
Double Suicide,1969,100,                      Masterly.                  
Taste the Blood of Dracula,1970,54,"                      A routine Dracula film, though well made.                  "
The Confession,1970,100,"                      Costa-Gavras and screenwriter Jorge Semprún’s approach doesn’t allow Kafkaesque sentiment, so the film stays tough and brilliant.                  "
Chisum,1970,83,                      One of the better efforts from Wayne's post-True Grit period.                  
Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed,1969,70,"                      Jones is astonishing as the anguished victim of the transplant, whose wife fails to recognise him and rejects him, prompting his revenge plan.                  "
Hercules in New York,1970,14,"                      A movie seemingly devoid of second takes, this debut for 22-year-old Arnold Schwarzenegger (née Strong) is a doggerel-filled, painfully unfunny, low-budget comedy set in Midnight Cowboy-era NYC.                  "
I Never Sang for My Father,1970,100,                      ...a predominantly successful stage-play adaptation...                  
Let It Be,1970,75,"                      The film is a bore. It's supposed to show how the Beatles work, but it doesn't. Shot without any design, clumsily edited, uninformative and naive, it would have destroyed a lesser group.                  "
Medea,1969,70,"                      Only for an art-house audience, but those who want to feel and poetically experience the ancient world might also find this odd film worth watching, at least once.                  "
The Night Visitor,1971,13,"                      Laslo Benedek's methodical direction and Henning Kristiansen's astonishing photography-a gothic mix of melancholy blue landscapes and pale, crumbling interiors-only serve to underline the film's deficiency, the utter lack of logic.                  "
On a Clear Day You Can See Forever,1970,100,                      There are several good reasons why certain stars are paid astronomical sums for doing what comes naturally on the screen. And all of them apply to Barbra Streisand in On a Clear Day You Can See Forever.                  
The Owl and the Pussycat,1970,82,                      ...the new permissiveness also gives Segal and Streisand plenty of chances to shine...                  
THX 1138,1971,86,                      ...devoid of even the most basic exposition designed to draw the viewer into its oddball futuristic landscape...                  
When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth,1970,17,                      The Oscar-nominated visual effects overwhelm the so-so storyline.                  
The Touch,1971,65,"                      Shallow and unconvincing as a love story, failing to make its characters emerge as anything other than the stock types in any random early '70s adultery drama.                  "
The Devils,1971,69,"                      More than its images of medieval exorcism or nuns writhing in demonic ecstasy, it is how Russell critiques and questions the institutions held dear by Western civilization that earned the film its notorious reputation and censorship.                   "
Dirty Harry,1971,89,                      Its star’s growling charisma demands to be enjoyed.                  
The Horsemen,1971,30,                      I refuse to believe that the dreadful Hollywood-archaic screenplay which numbs The Horsemen (Astoria) was entirely the work of Dalton Trumbo as the credits vouchsafe.                  
Klute,1971,93,                      That it succeeds is mostly due to Fonda. Calling her performance powerhouse would be a grand understatement.                  
Land of Silence and Darkness,1971,83,"                      The subject is, by any standard, worth suffering the sometimes dodgy filmmaking.                  "
The Last Run,1971,40,"                      In any guise, George C. Scott is worth watching, though his performance here seems haunted by the same tedious resignation that atrophies the script.                  "
Making It,1971,17,"                      As the 17-year-old Casanova, Kristoffer Tabori gives a performance that is smart and funny and even touching.                  "
Death in Venice,1971,70,"                      Visconti finds beauty not only in Andrésen and the exquisite city of love, but also in the storytelling.                   "
Murders in the Rue Morgue,1971,20,"                      ""It's a very loose version of Poe's book.                  "
Wake in Fright,1971,97,                      Reaches a level of anxiety-inducing terror that few other films have achieved.                   
Pretty Maids All in a Row,1971,8,"                      Gathering together the distinguished selection of Hudson, Dickinson, and Savalas for a story so deliciously eccentric is perhaps its greatest success.                  "
Private Road,1971,83,"                      Whatever its limitations -- and there are some -- it tries very hard to get near to what things are like here and now, what pressures people face and what they do about them.                  "
Shaft,1971,87,"                      Quintessential blaxploitation that launched a thousand imitators, Gordon Parks’s Shaft is much more than a rollicking crowd-pleaser, as it’s also a snapshot of a bygone era.                  "
They Might Be Giants,1971,75,"                      We could all be Holmes and, even more interestingly, Moriarty, in this case spectators without compassion, nor criteria, nor memory, judging, dictating the mental state of the two central characters. [Full Review in Spanish]                  "
The Emigrants,1971,93,"                      The Emigrants is a mighty picture, powerful in its simplicity and earthiness, beautiful in its presentation, inspiring in its theme and message. The people are real people, the story is a real story.                  "
Villain,1971,67,"                      ...bridge between traditional British policiers and the more modern take on criminality featured in, say, The Long Good Friday....                  "
Wild Rovers,1971,60,                      An enjoyable movie—a Hollywood Western with all the essential elements plus trimmings.                  
Zachariah,1971,50,                      Zachariah proclaims itself the first electric Western but has little distinction otherwise.                  
Something Big,1971,0,                      I haven't seen a Dean Martin movie since How to Save A Marriage and Ruin Your Life where his talent was really used.                  
1776,1972,74,"                      Great screenplay based on the Broadway musical. Fantastic musical in an amazing 3-disc 4K/blu-ray set from Sony,                  "
Love in the Afternoon,1972,82,                      Love in the Afternoon deserves credit for its artistic merit but also for serving as the beginning of a beautiful affair between Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond.                  
Cabaret,1972,92,"                      As presented, Cabaret is something else again: a pretentious, bad musical.                  "
The Candidate,1972,88,"                      On the heels of one of the ugliest elections in American history, “The Candidate” is a light and frothy escape by comparison.                  "

Jeremiah Johnson,1972,95,"                      A 1970s zeitgeist Western...among Redford's most endearing and enduring performances, a sensitive yet heroic figure, a man out of his depth who has to grow and revert to a form of savagery to master it. .                  "
Fist of Fury,1972,83,"                      the violence is a mix of the realistic and the fantastical, with Lee's intense physicality giving the film an undeniable presence that also leaves room for Wei's preference for hyper-stylized action that defies the laws of physics                  "
Lone Wolf and Cub Sword of Vengeance,1972,83,                      Kenji Misumi directs a film that wonderfully combines artistry with exploitation elements                  
Lone Wolf and Cub Baby Cart at the River Styx,1972,100,                      Baby Cart at Styx is a great entry in the saga and a film that fans of exploitation are bound to adore.                  
Man of La Mancha,1972,47,                      An ugly and unseemly adaptation.                  
Pocket Money,1972,50,                      ...relentlessly off-kilter...                  
Season of the Witch,1972,67,"                      Season of the Witch first made the rounds under the titles Jack's Wife and Hungry Wives, and either is a better representation of the film's content than Season of the Witch.                  "
Slaughter,1972,20,                      Most of the action is staged so badly and the dialogue delivered so awkwardly that the effect is ludicrous.                  
Tales from the Crypt,1972,90,                      The best vignette finds Peter Cushing delivering one of the finest performances of his long career.                  
Tout Va Bien,1972,50,"                      Accumulating in a mosaic different styles and opposing attitudes, Jean-Luc Godard ends up abandoning his viewers, and worse yet, he also bores them at times. [Full Review in Spanish]                  "
Your Vice Is a Locked Room and Only I Have the Key,1972,100,"                      ...a wonderfully lurid, pervy and overheated melodrama...                  "
Ash Wednesday,1973,9,"                      Ash Wednesday is so bad that even Liz Taylor's performance becomes almost inconspicuous in it. Fonda and Keith Baxter do act a bit, but only just, and Helmut Berger doesn't even try, which seems to come naturally to him.                  "
Battle for the Planet of the Apes,1973,36,"                      The problem here is basically one of script, though the lowering of production values has taken its toll.                  "
Blume in Love,1973,68,"                      The film almost loses sight of poor Blume and turns into a social satire. As such, however, it fails to expose very much or to take a very clear stand toward the social trends it dramatizes.                  "

Carny,1980,57,"                      Carny is an odd, ugly, but satisfying mixture of lots of things...It’s a double-edged metaphor that turns to explain itself: the sex is as much as the hustle as the hustle is of the sex.                   "
Fame,1980,82,"                      Not only is the singing and dancing in this movie excellent, it is also done in a spontaneous and natural way, giving it a realistic quality much more exciting and inspiring than the staged musical sequences in most movie musicals.                  "
First Family,1980,20,                      Disappointing acerbic political satire directed and written by Buck Henry.                  
The Fog,1980,75,                      The Fog is a neat twist on the classic ghost story. Carpenter achieves a palpable sense of dread and atmosphere and his score remains a signature piece of the experience he sets out to provide. The characters are unfortunately the weakest element here.                  
Forbidden Zone,1980,83,"                      Where else can one see Fantasy Island's Herve Villechaize as the king of another dimension, an Oscar nominee as his wife, and Batman / Spider-Man composer Danny Elfman as Satan?                  "
Heart Beat,1980,20,"                      John Byrum has achieved an honest film, narrated with the sobriety of the testimony, just as its characters deserved. [Full Review in Spanish]                  "
Honeysuckle Rose,1980,60,                      Honeysuckle Rose is not so much a movie as a visual gloss for the bestselling country-and-western records of Willie Nelson.                  
The Human Factor,1979,33,                      The first part is the best aspect of the film. The second seems colder and more mundane. [Full Review in Spanish]                  
The Hunter,1980,50,"                      There's a messy accumulation of scenes, effects, and resources that seem like an overview of Steve McQueen's previous films. [Full Review in Spanish]                  "
The Island,1980,33,"                      Once these piratical hordes enter the picture, Caine stops talking — and acting...  The Island actually makes The Deep look good.                  "
Maniac,1980,37,"                      Spinell's performance and uncomfortable screen presence is what really makes Maniac memorable, not to mention some excellent make-up effects from Tom Savini.                  "
Ordinary People,1980,89,"                      It does not want to shock you, provoke you, frighten you, intellectually stimulate you, or even teach you anything you do not already know.                  "
Out of the Blue,1980,95,"                      This is not a hopeful film, nor is it nihilistic. Whether you like it or not, the film acknowledges the need to make personal responses in the face of the inadequacy of social solutions.                   "
Private Benjamin,1980,83,"                      Whether the collaboration of three screen writers gave this sometimes delightful, sometimes interminable motion picture an identity crisis, is anyone's guess.                   "
The Shining,1980,82,                      Kubrick sabotages his own thesis in the most knuckleheaded way conceivable: we can't be charged as accomplices in horror when there is no horror.                   
Up the Academy,1980,0,                      I can't remember anticipating the end of a film with such exuberance.                  
Absence of Malice,1981,81,                      Director Pollack does a fine job at keeping this tense and emotionally charged story on the right track throughout.                  
Contamination,1980,40,"                      The scares aren't constant enough to make it much of a horror film, while the science-fiction elements aren't futuristic enough to impart much to that genre, either.                  "
Body Heat,1981,98,"                      Kasdan’s first feature showed a veteran’s level of assurance and confidence. From the writing to the direction to the character arcs to the crack ensemble performances, “Body Heat” is one of the finest examples of film noir ever made.                  "
Chariots of Fire,1981,83,"                      This is a beautiful, unhurried film that unfolds a vision of the past that reminds us there once existed a time of innocence and tradition.                   "
Clash of the Titans,1981,63,"                      For me, Clash of the Titans fails as a film because its dramatic structure is so unsound.                  "
Continental Divide,1981,73,                      The film is at its best when it ignores their relationship and concentrates on other matters.                  
The Decline of Western Civilization,1981,100,"                      The film's style is as brutal, stripped-down and purposefully devoid of frills as the music of its subjects.                  "
Excalibur,1981,73,                      Excalibur is an embarrassment... it’s the banality of much of the dialogue in Excalibur that’s so depressing.                  
Fear No Evil,1981,50,"                      Fear No Evil is pompous, silly and contusing, but it also has several interesting sequences and a great deal of conviction... still worth seeing                  "
Final Exam,1981,13,                      It might be more fun taking a final exam than watching such crap.                  
The Funhouse,1981,70,"                      The imaginatively designed funhouse, oddball characters along the periphery, and a masterfully staged climax allow this to stand out.                  "
Circle of Deceit,1981,100,"                      It is a rough film to sit through, but sitting through it is definitely a worthwhile and illuminating experience.                  "
Graduation Day,1981,57,"                      For a cheap cash-in (which this no doubt is), there's still a solid amount going on under Graduation Day's hood, even as the bodies begin to pile toward the ceiling.                  "
Madman,1981,33,                      There is not one lota of originality in this depressing and insulting steal from the Friday the 13th series with a touch of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre thrown in for good measure.                  
Cannibal Ferox,1981,40,"                      Cannibal Ferox might not fit most people's idea of entertainment but you, dear readers, are not most people. Well worth a look if you have the stomach for it.                  "
Outland,1981,54,"                      Boasting an energizing blend of Western showdowns in sci-fi environs at the climax, this space-going actioner is an entertaining, competent, unique mix of genre films.                  "
Prince of the City,1981,92,"                      It is a film without answers, but the questions it raises couldn't be more critical.                  "
Quartet,1981,44,"                      The final scene confirms, I think, the weakness of the cinema artist who must rely on vision where the writer would add depth.                  "
Tarzan the Ape Man,1981,10,"                      The scriptwriters only bothered to put together a boring adventure, where the only good thing is the professional work of Richard Harris. [Full Review in Spanish]                  "
Under the Rainbow,1981,0,"                      Before the success of Princess Leia in her metal bikini, here Fisher is stripped down to her underwear - one of the only notable elements of this highly forgettable film.                  "
Victory,1981,63,                      Intermittently entertaining if also exceedingly imbecilic.                  
Alone in the Dark,1982,69,                      A fun little non-slasher slasher movie that works as a horror film.                  
Annie,1982,49,"                      A kid with Annie's moxie deserves more. Or perhaps less. What she deserves is an atmosphere of innocence, warmth and inventiveness, to let the film generate the joy that must have enveloped theater audiences over the past five years.                  "
Best Friends,1982,62,"                      So far, this sounds like a series of fairly predictable scenes. But they're redeemed by the writing and acting. The dialogue doesn't sound like reprocessed sitcom, and there are charming moments.                  "
Blade Runner,1982,94,"                      ... an overwhelming, immersive experience, a total creation of a possible future so complete that you don’t need exposition to know how we got from here to there.                  "
The Challenge,1982,50,                      It's much better than the routine chop-socky karate film.                  
Creepshow,1982,65,                      We aren't spared the expected gross-out special effects; it's just that Creepshow has been directed with wit and love for the genre.                   
Deathtrap,1982,72,                       Deathtrap is clever but largely unoriginal.                  
Diner,1982,91,"                      The humor (some of it steeped in nostalgia and sentimentality), even during the more notorious sequences, is never strong enough to transcend the limitations of its minimal scope and setting and lack of a traditional narrative.                  "
Firefox,1982,38,"                      Eastwood looks like an automated totem pole, the Russians are portrayed as the Three Stooges, and there's more drama, tension and action in a spoonful of cottage cheese than in this painfully drawn-out affair.                  "
Five Days One Summer,1982,14,"                      Everything that appears onscreen fails to elicit emotion, and the ending is gratuitous. [Full Review in Spanish]                  "
Honkytonk Man,1982,93,"                      Today it looks much better, and contains one of Eastwood's most openhearted performances.                  "
Losing Ground,1982,100,"                      Ignored and undistributed upon its debut in 1982, in the decades since, the film “Losing Ground” has slowly gained the recognition it deserves.                  "
My Favorite Year,1982,96,"                      My Favorite Year is a film that rises -- and sometimes soars -- on the beauty of its central idea and on the loving, intelligent way it’s been fleshed out.                  "
Night Shift,1982,93,"                      When the two stars of ""Happy Days"" reunited to make a movie about a mild-mannered young man who finds a way out of his crisis of masculinity, by becoming a pimp. (40th anniversary)                     "
Parasite,1982,15,                      Exists totally for its 3-D images and getting through the turgid plot in between is really quite a haul.                  
Sans Soleil,1983,87,"                      Marker the intellectual, the theorist of montage, and the leftist are all evident in Sans Soleil, whose intellectual breadth seems ostentatious at first but eventually coheres.                  "
El Sur,1983,100,                      A fascinating and emotional dream that is not interrupted for the audience. [Full Review in Spanish]                  
Swamp Thing,1982,60,                      Swamp Thing contains some of the most banal lines heard in years and its non-existent characterization renders any intended pathos pathetic.                  
Yes Giorgio,1982,33,                      There's no imagination in the story or script to even justify the musical interventions of the tenor. [Full Review in Spanish]                  
Brainstorm,1983,57,"                      When combined with such vision and such application of large-format filmmaking, elevation occurs past popcorn thrills to memorable chills. It's some kind of masterpiece, rivaled only by the works of James Cameron (yes) and Terrence Malick (for sure).                  "
A Christmas Story,1983,90,                      Bob Clark’s little Christmas movie “A Christmas Story” has vaulted into full Christmas Classic status.                  
Deal of the Century,1983,11,"                      A stupid, unfunny affair which wastes the talents of its stars Chevy Chase, Sigourney Weaver, Gregory Hines and Wallace Shawn.                  "
Lovesick,1983,40, 
Marlene,1984,100,"                      Schell’s film is therefore an achievement, building on the heterodox, oblique-angled technique of Marcel Ophuls to reconstruct Dietrich’s life like a mood piece.                  "
The Outsiders,1983,69,"                      This overwrought, stylized teen melodrama might only hold your interest if you were young enough to be impressed by it in 1983.                  "
Star Wars Episode VI Return of the Jedi,1983,83,                      Without fail “Return of the Jedi” ignites a near childlike enthusiasm inside of me every time I watch it.                  
Risky Business,1983,92,                      ... Reminiscent of The Graduate in its slick satirical tone and its way with words.                  
Star 80,1983,81,
Stroker Ace,1983,20,                      A knuckleheaded but amiable summer trifle.                  
Sudden Impact,1983,57,                      The movie deserves credit for wading through the same muddy waters as Dirty Harry and Magnum Force.                  
Superman III,1983,30,                      Superman III belongs to Richard Pryor as Gus Gorman who gives a marvelously understated comic performance.                  
Testament,1983,89,"                      Living an unspeakable nightmare from which there's no waking, [Alexander] suggests a resilient admirable core of humanity.                  "
Trading Places,1983,88,                      Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd are quite the duo in this funny Christmas film with some strong themes under its hood. [Full review in Spanish]                  
Confidentially Yours,1983,78,                      Truffaut evokes such a pale reflection of the prototypes he's copying that the results might be more accurately described as noir blah.                  
2010 The Year We Make Contact,1984,66,                      Hyams' decision to separate his film from Kubrick`s one plays much more in favor of the very good feelings that the production leaves than it might seem at first glance. [Full Review in Spanish]                  
The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension,1984,66,"                      Unmistakably tongue-in-cheek, the movie follows Buckaroo (Peter Weller) to the frontier of ultra-hip sci-fi parody. John Lithgow gets a chance to pull out all the stops as a mad scientist, and when things are funny they’re very much so.                  "
Bolero,1984,0,"                      When you look at the first sequence in Bolero, it's clear that this is just a picture book. [Full Review in Spanish]                  "
Firstborn,1984,36,"                      Firstborn is the film we knew Apted had in him when we saw the care and craftsmanship in his Coal Miner's Daughter and Continental Divide. It's a find, and Collet's singular performance is its core.                  "
1984,1984,72,"                      The moviemaking suggests a slow descent into a quiet, awful nightmare.                  "
Once Upon a Time in America,1984,87,                      Once Upon a Time in America is a tremendous work that captures the animating ambition and sorrow at the heart of the American Dream.                  
Police Academy,1984,57,                      ...somewhat erratic yet mostly affable...                  
Purple Hearts,1984,20,"                      On balance, Purple Hearts is much better for its parts than for its whole.                  "
Purple Rain,1984,70,                      I recommend it as a piece of 80s pop culture with some great music and corny romance. At the very least check out the soundtrack. It's legendary!                  
Razorback,1984,58,                      The oddball nightmare style is effective but the prop pig and under par acting let the film down.                  
Reckless,1984,0,"                      Youth on the run can be a whole lot of fun, but Reckless, by first-time filmmaker James Foley, is a particularly dreary affair.                  "
Streetwise,1984,92,"                      The filmmakers have photographed and arranged this raw material so that we are distanced, rather than brought into it.                  "
Swing Shift,1984,87,"                      Swing Shift isn't boring, but nothing in it startles, nothing explodes.                  "
Tightrope,1984,85,"                      On an action fan's gut level, I like Eastwood. There's no other star who can pull off tense, John Wayneish moments so well.                  "
The NeverEnding Story,1984,83,"                      If you are looking for a family film that will not be offensive to any member of the family then Wolfgang Petersen’s (Troy, The Perfect Storm) “The Neverending Story” is a safe pick.                     "
After Hours,1985,91,"                      Immaculately shot (by Michael Ballhaus) and vibrantly acted, the movie has a nightmarish quality, a sense of events spinning crazily out of control.                  "
Agnes of God,1985,42,                      ...an excessively deliberate endeavor...                  
American Flyers,1985,67,                      Wears its cliches well.                  
Creature,1985,29,"                      There are far more laughs than real shocks... it doesn't really matter, after all, in space, no one can hear you groan.                  "
The Runner,1984,100,"                      To say that the 1984 movie doesn’t seem at all dated is almost an understatement. I can’t think of any 2022 film that radiates so much joy in the act of filmmaking, or that can serve as such an electrifying inspiration to younger artists.                  "
Demons,1985,64,                      Disreputable fun.                  
The Doctor and the Devils,1985,0,                      Feels as though the plot could do even more with its material.                  
Detective,1985,91,"                      Once or twice I thought I espied a theme, much as a birdwatcher after a long vigil in the freezing dawn might think he espied a rare bird. But either I was wrong or it flew away before identification.                  "
Fair Game,1986,64,"                      Suspend your disbelief, get a little intoxicated if you’re of age, if that’s your thing, and you’ll most certainly enjoy this wildly entertaining piece of trash.                  "
Gymkata,1985,17,"                      This really happened in Hollywood in the 1980s, which gives you some idea of exactly how much cocaine was flowing through that place back then.                  "
Heaven Help Us,1985,29,                      Its view of both the teenagers and the adults gets so mired in the most juvenile cartoon stereotypes that it totally fails in presenting a full picture of human beings.                  
Krush Groove,1985,43,                      Stick with the soundtrack.                  
Ladyhawke,1985,65,"                      Richard Donner has made Ladyhawke an uncontroversial fairy tale for young children, as the film's blandness and stereotype performances...offers nothing interesting, let alone new.                  "
Lost in America,1985,95,"                      The script is rarely funny and often far too talkative, and the small amount of action is flat-footed. Brooks and his co-star, Julie Hagerty, do not show enough sparkle in their acting to make up for these deficiencies.                  "
Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome,1985,81,"                      If Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome doesn't live up to the pace and power of its predecessors, its richer visual style and more substantial storyline and characterizations, are a welcome, if not wholly successful, change in emphasis.

Pale Rider,1985,93,                      The main feeling of the film is of a tongue-in-cheek parody of the spaghetti sagas.                   
Police Academy 2 Their First Assignment,1985,29,"                      Police Academy 2 won't win any awards and its humor is pure slapstick. Like most of the number sequels, this is a pale imitation of the first.                  "
Taipei Story,1985,100,                      A mournful odyssey of one couple's promising future slowly eroded in the changing landscape of China's consumer culture.                  
Red Sonja,1985,21,"                      Red Sonja isn't camp enough to be funny, just boring.                  "
Vagabond,1985,100,"                      Through this tough, memorable film, Ms. Varda reaches for our humanity with a force that very few movies can muster.                  "
Spies Like Us,1985,32,"                      Dated '80s comedy has strong language, few laughs.                  "
Spookies,1986,29,                      Not particularly creepy but it’s kooky. Mysterious but not spooky. Certainly all together ooky. It’s the Spookies moo-o-vie.                  
Transylvania 6 5000,1985,18,"                      The anti-Young Frankenstein, Transylvania 6-5000 might be the worst horror-comedy ever made.                  "
Twice in a Lifetime,1985,83, 
Vision Quest,1985,60,"                      Vision Quest improves substantially as it progresses into a midsection rife with appealing, entertaining subplots...                  "
Year of the Dragon,1985,56,                      Defenders claim it's a blow against racism and sexism while detractors insist it embraces racism and sexism. One's opinion will perhaps depend on whether the viewing ends with admiration for its technical prowess or annoyance at its narrative ugliness.                  
Betty Blue,1986,78,"                      Betty Blue evinces a filmmaker with a profound understanding of desire: The mysteries of its creation and sustenance, as well as the irrational choices it can induce us to make.                  "
Club Paradise,1986,11,"                      A slapdash, mostly unfunny disaster...                  "
Cobra,1986,18,                      It is such an exercise in pure unchecked and misplaced testosterone run amuck... that it exerts strange but undeniable fascination.                  
Critters,1986,50,"                      The lead monsters are sort of endearingly nasty and the movie has fun with its small town setting, but the film is perhaps a little too derivative to pass muster with the best of retro-chic [science fiction].                  "
Deadly Friend,1986,13,"                      Craven’s original vision was totally compromised and while I don’t think it would’ve worked at least it would have been the film Wes wanted to make.

Heartbreak Ridge,1986,68,                      Eastwood serves us up with a hoary old story about a platoon of malcontents whipped into fighting shape by a tough veteran sergeant.                  
Invaders from Mars,1986,38,"                      ...the first half of Invaders From Mars is easily the best, with a strange off-kilter feel that comes from slavishly updating a 50's storyline...                  "
The Mission,1986,67,"                      Despite Strong and De Niro conquering the film as a two-hander, the remaining cast does not live up to The Mission's leads.                  "
The Name of the Rose,1986,75,"                      James Horner provides excellent music, and Dante ""Salo"" Ferretti does his usual phenomenal job with the production design.                  "
The Sacrifice,1986,86,"                      A plentiful and elaborate work of art... Still, a lot of the scenario is rather trite.                  "
One Crazy Summer,1986,45,"                      Fresh off 1985's Better Off Dead, writer-director Savage Steve Holland and star John Cusack reunited for One Crazy Summer, which is basically more of the same minus that great ""Two dollars!"" running gag.                  "
Police Academy 3 Back in Training,1986,40,                      More of same slap-shtick w/familiar cast of goofballs.                  
Power,1986,50,"                      Before it turns slack and sentimental, ""Power,"" Sidney Lumet's foray into the world of political consultants, crackles with a kind of moral static.                  "
Pretty in Pink,1986,73,"                      There is strong work among the supporting players: while Ringwald and McCarthy are amiable enough, other performers around them constantly threaten to steal the limelight.                  "
A Room with a View,1985,100,                      A Room With a View is an outstanding period piece. It captures Forster's characters in their milieu with a temperament that effectively stirs modern-day sensitivities.                  
Stand by Me,1986,92,                      Rob Reiner should’ve gotten at least like one cool mention in a Beastie Boys song for his hot streak.                  
True Stories,1986,79,                      I still find True Stories to be an endearingly weird and charming film that still holds up pretty well today.                  
Wildcats,1986,26,"                      ""Wildcats"" doesn't reach its potential, but it's mild entertainment for those hunting for something that's easy on the senses.                  "
Wise Guys,1986,31,"                      It's tempting to dismiss ""Wise Guys"" as a pointless, ill-advised forebear to ""Dumb and Dumber."" But even if only for an act, you sense De Palma striving for more artful zaniness a la the Marx Brothers or a grimmer side of the Ealing Comedy spectrum.                  "

The Believers,1987,35,                      There is a depressingly surprising ending in tune with the current tendency to let the forces of darkness prevail for the sake of profitable sequels. Invincible evil seems to sell like hotcakes in today’s marketplace.

Daughter of the Nile,1987,100,"                      A fascinating blend of genre and familial dysfunction melodrama, weaving together the escapist fantasy of the manga (from which the film derives its name) and the plight of some resilient siblings.                  "
Dark Eyes,1987,90,"                      This feeble revelation, however, hardly makes the preceding footage worth the wait...                  "

Bird,1988,83,"                      People who don't like jazz often complain it's overlong, complicated, noodling, and meandering. These criticisms can all be leveled at director Clint Eastwood's Bird, who, unlike a jazz master, doesn't back up his work with any inventive flair.                  "

Reversal of Fortune,1990,92,"                      As distant and icy as Jeremy Irons' Oscar-winning performance as suspected murderer Claus von Bülow, but like Irons' inscrutable steeliness, it's also endlessly compelling.                  "

The Rookie,1990,29,"                      Clint's in this car wreck doing his usual macho thing, which might be enough to satisfy his fans.                  "

Curly Sue,1991,13,"                      Everyone who has to do with it -- particularly John Hughes, the writer, director and producer of it -- should be ashamed.                  "

Doc Hollywood,1991,68,"                      It may have been lightly regarded when it came out, but I think you can make the case that ""Doc Hollywood,"" a throwback comedy even then, stands the test of time better than most any rom-com of its era.                   "
Guilty by Suspicion,1991,67,                      The fact that Guilty by Suspicion has been made at all shows to what extent we’ve recovered; the fact that it leaves so much of the story still untold shows to what extent we haven’t.                   
A Brighter Summer Day,1991,100,"                      “A Brighter Summer Day” swept me away into a world of juvenile delinquency and rock and roll. Politically charged and boasting with energy, Yang’s novelistic vision is something to behold.                   "
The Hitman,1991,13,                      Entertainingly bad.

Voyager,1991,56,                      The whole thing came over as the worst kind of middle-aged fantasy.                  
JFK,1991,85,"                      A big, thick piece of work, a leatherbound refutation of the Warren Commission Report.                  "

Queen of Diamonds,1991,100,"                      Queen of Diamonds-refreshingly, vitally, radically-is part of another women's cinema, one that knows that any feminism worthy of the name cannot be grounded in an ideology of individual achievement...                  "

Robin Hood Prince of Thieves,1991,51,"                      Adds up to an enjoyable reimagining of the familiar Robin Hood mythology, filled with a deep cast- if you can get past Costner's accent (30th anniversary)                  "
Rover Dangerfield,1991,40,                      The most interesting aspect is Rodney Dangerfield's transformation into a cartoon character.                  
Run,1991,0,"                      Run does, however, have the best death by a mechanical track rabbit scene ever recorded. That should be worth a footnote in the annuals of Hollywood when Run is long forgotten.                  "
Rush,1991,71,"                      Though well-acted, well-written and well-directed, it's still an unpleasant watch that never gets beyond being routine.                  "

Bad Lieutenant,1992,77,"                      Keitel's performance is courageous, almost psychotic, because it is deeply and profoundly authentic.                  "
Basic Instinct,1992,57,                      Sharon Stone radiates on screen in Paul Verhoeven's erotic thriller.                  
Batman Returns,1992,81,"                      As always, the story is a clothesline for grand, lavish images. The surprise here is that they’re darker, more painfully felt.                   "
The Bodyguard,1992,38,"                      Houston is a revelation as the strong-willed, free-spirited, but lonely diva and single mother-of-one more concerned for her eight-year-old son's safety than her own.                  "
Captain America,1990,12,"                      The biggest flaw isn’t so much the acting, the directing, or the screenwriting (all of which deserve demerits) but that the movie’s meager budget doesn’t allow it to look cinematic.                  "
Class Act,1992,17,"                      This movie was really nothing but fluff for the decade, featuring hot hip-hop stars of the day.                  "
Don Quixote,1992,43,"                      The film is an essay on Spain, and also an essay on Welles. Welles shared the Don's magniloquence, boundless self-esteem, ruinous generosity, romantic illusions and moral fervour.                  "
Wuthering Heights,1992,25,"                      A film that really should never have been made, it'll have you running back to the book to remember just how good it is.                  "
Falling from Grace,1992,78,"                      Falling From Grace is not a perfect film, but it's an enjoyable film.                  "
Damage,1992,78,                      The worst thing about Damages is David Hare's screenplay. It is constructed mostly out of embarrassingly meaningful looks.                  
Final Analysis,1992,56,                      Final Analysis is gold-plated pulp.                  
Forever Young,1992,54,"                      There’s no emotional epiphany of the mistake he might have made, just a rom-com-esque race against the clock that’s more a showcase for what could be done with make-up to rapidly age a character...                  "
Freejack,1992,26,                      A relentlessly lowbrow but well-paced sci-fi actioner.                  
Howards End,1992,94,                      ...an uneven work of adaptation.                  
Innocent Blood,1992,38,                      An anemic effort that fails to make the most of a great hook.                  
Lethal Weapon 3,1992,58,                      A celebration of Los Angeles police brutality and large-scale explosions...                  
Malcolm X,1992,88,"                      Spike Lee's Malcolm X is a curiously conventional biopic of an extraordinary individual, dutifully laying out his life story, but ultimately saying little about the man himself.                    "
Memoirs of an Invisible Man,1992,26,"                      In a better time and universe and film industry, the assertion of one creative personality wouldn’t necessarily entail the trampling or effacement of another.                  "
Passenger 57,1992,24,
Pastime,1990,44, 
Pure Country,1992,41,"                      As directed by Christopher Cain, Strait's first feature will probably not go down as a classic contemporary western nor a great modern musical. But it lopes along pleasantly, and Strait effortlessly makes the crossover into acting.                  "
The Story of Qiu Ju,1992,87,                      The film’s integrity is chiefly a matter of countless small but uncommon observations...                  
The Quarrel,1991,100,"                      Directed by Israeli-born Eli Cohen, it is a movie of words that unfolds like a stage play in the park, stately but stolid.                  "
Twin Dragons,1992,44,"                      Even with a rambunctious finale, the focus remains on playful and mischievous skirmishes rather than highly creative showdowns - a shame in a Jackie Chan production.                  "

Where the Day Takes You,1992,80,"                      Though hovering between art and sociology, realism and stylization, Rocco's film serves as showcase for young cohort of actors including Will Smith, Sean Astin, Dermot Mulroney, Lara Flynn Boyle and Balthazar Getty.                  "
Airborne,1993,21,                      The occasional action scenes are as appropriately tortuous as the tired teen-out-of-water plot is torturous. This is a kid-flick that's speed-skating on one leg.                  
Amongst Friends,1993,33,"                      Rob Weiss's Amongst Friends, a gangster rites-of-passage tale, owes much to Mean Streets and Goodfellas -- reminiscing voice-overs, bustling hand-held camera, boys bonding and boiling over -- but it has its own slender charm.                  "
Arizona Dream,1993,87,"                      Though entertaining at times, it's not everyone's dream pic.                  "
Bad Behaviour,1993,100,"                      Although Bad Behaviour flirts with clichés, it keeps veering away from them at the last minute, offering subtle surprises right down to a delightfully ragged ending.                  "
Batman Mask of the Phantasm,1993,86,"                      While it is my first look into a gritty Batman, this is light work compared to the things we have gotten since. Still a very solid superhero film.                   "
Being Human,1994,54,"                      An ultra- whimsical reverie on love and family through the ages. Sometimes archly cute, finally deeply sentimental...                  "
Supercop 2,1993,60,"                      Although there is death and destruction, blood is minimal; the purpose is primarily to showcase exceptional fight choreography, with Yeoh's athleticism at the forefront.                  "
A Dangerous Woman,1993,54,                      Debra Winger turns in a performance that deserves a place among the great acting work in recent movie history. If only anyone had seen it.                  
Dave,1993,95,"                      Pulls off the rare feat of being rooted in politics without displaying any partisanship. Sophisticated but relatable and smart, it is a comedy with endless charm and an ability to impart a common sense message without standing on a soap box doing so.                  "

Fearless,1993,85,"                      An exploration of grief, PTSD, and how near-death experiences impact survivors. Rosie Perez deserves her acting nomination giving a raw heartbreaking performance.                  "

Gettysburg,1993,77,"                      More frenetic than a re-enactment, less assuming than a lecture, and even less sentimental than a Hollywood drama.                  "
Grumpy Old Men,1993,64,"                      Few movies of this increasingly burgeoning genre have reached the same heights, today’s efforts increasingly sanitised, formularised and joyless. Everything Grumpy Old Men is most certainly not.                  "

M Butterfly,1993,43,"                      On screen, under the caring but superficial direction of David Cronenberg, the realism of the camera cruelly exposes all the pretenses of this play about a French diplomat who loves a man posing as a woman.                  "
My Favorite Season,1993,93,"                      My Favorite Season-Deneuve's third film with director André Téchiné, and which he cowrote expressly for her-gives the actress one of the richest, most equitable relationships she's ever shared with a male co-lead.                  "

RoboCop 3,1993,6,"                      While the sight of a flying RoboCop isn't as offensive as the sight of a flying R2-D2, it still registers as an awful idea.                  "
Searching for Bobby Fischer,1993,100,"                      The fields of math, music, chess, and acting all produce child prodigies. Luckily for us, lead child actor Max Pomeranc can check two prodigy boxes.                  "
Son in Law,1993,21,                      Dated '90s Pauly Shore comedy has frequent sexual references                  
Three of Hearts,1993,53,"                      Even with such an offbeat trio, Three of Hearts proves curiously banal, neither sexy nor witty.                  "

Above Suspicion,1995,60,"                      a fairly satisfying murder thriller, with a particularly memorable, well-acted climax                  "
Ace Ventura Pet Detective,1994,48,                      The twist ending is unnecessary and has the unsavory side effect of teaching millions of young Ace fans that it’s unimaginably gross for a man to kiss a trans woman ­­ — this from a movie whose hero talks out of his butt.                  
The Air Up There,1994,21, 
Barcelona,1994,83,"                      Though reflecting the superficial antics of two self-involved men, Barcelona is a comical analysis of privileged perspectives.                  "
Black Beauty,1994,81,"                      The film's episodic nature may work against sustained involvement, but it shows us Black Beauty's nomadic existence.                  "
Colonel Chabert,1994,83, 
Death and the Maiden,1994,82,"                      Miss Weaver plays the victim with quite astonishing intensity, and deals with Mr. Kingsley in a manner that is quite convincing.                  "
Disclosure,1994,60,"                      It's glossy and hokey, but it is also good storytelling. More importantly, within its aims, it's a lot of fun.                   "
Dolores Claiborne,1995,85,"                      Aided by strong performances, Hackford keeps the suspense simmering nicely until a botched courtroom showdown... Interesting, though, to see Stephen King in the guise of feminist.                   "
Dumb and Dumber,1994,68,                      It isn’t nonstop hilarity; there are quite a few dead spots. But I liked it a lot.                  
Little Big League,1994,33,"                      Little Big League avoids the usual ending, but then tacks on an even more corny upbeat prologue.                  "
The Little Rascals,1994,23,"                      A dismal kids' comedy in which all creativity stopped after casting lookalikes for the old ""rascals"" was completed.                  "

Natural Born Killers,1994,48,"                      Depending on your sensibilities, this controversial 1994 crime drama was either Oliver Stone's magnum opus, or the moment he crossed a line. Either way, it was certainly designed to be provocative.                  "
On Deadly Ground,1994,12,                      [On Deadly Ground] has all the thrills and suspense of a rerun of Barney and Friends.                  
Ready to Wear,1994,24,                      You can't satirize industries that are inherently self-satirizing.

The Specialist,1994,10,                      ...the movie remains watchable enough from start to finish due mostly to a smattering of compelling set-pieces and Woods’ perpetually spellbinding performance...                  
Speed,1994,94,"                      A technical exercise so relentless, yet also so light of foot and heart, that it comes close to the summer-movie version of art.                  "
Satantango,1994,100,"                      You not only make it through but actually enjoy nearly eight hours of rainy, black-and-white bleakness about the failure of a communal farm, and you've earned significant envy in some quarters.                  "
The Day the Sun Turned Cold,1994,80,"                      We may choose to regard Day the Sun Turned Cold as an art movie or a genre exercise–truthfully, it can easily be seen as either one–but certainly a film this entertaining, even mesmerizing, surpasses the standards of most current Hollywood story-telling.

With Honors,1994,19,                      Keshishian has smoothly made the transition from fringe to commercial by taking a fairly ordinary story and crafting it into a highly entertaining drama.                  
Wyatt Earp,1994,31,                      The movie’s potential as a complex epic Western leaks out somewhere in the second hour.

Beyond Rangoon,1995,37,"                      The movie artfully appeals to some of the more hypocritical parts of my liberal conscience and gives them a gentle workout, but it doesn’t really change anything–except the bank accounts of a few studio executives...                  "
Boys on the Side,1995,75,"                      A hoot and a holler, and surely the best cheap thrill.                  "
The Brady Bunch Movie,1995,63,                      The only attempt at stretching the wooden characters involves middle daughter Jan being teed off at perfect older sister Marcia and throwing a few fits. We smile the first time.                  
Die Hard with a Vengeance,1995,58,"                      If you are an action fan you will love Die Hard With A Vengeance. All you need is a strong stomach and a penchant for masochism.

Forget Paris,1995,48, 
Free Willy 2 The Adventure Home,1995,50,"                      ""Free Willy 2"" is not the kind of film that can teach children about coping with loss or reach them on anything but the most superficial level.                  "
Friday,1995,76,                      This film is a laugh a minute and portrays realistic characters each of us can relate to.                  
Georgia,1995,80,                      A nearly perfect movie about a nearly total screw-up.

Heat,1995,88,"                      Hard hitting and full of spirit, Heat delivers on the action as well as the nuanced characters, raising it above the standard 90s cop drama.                  "
Just Cause,1995,26,"                      Paced like a courtroom drama, with a devious plot featuring an above-standard presentation of hunting for clues, uncovering conspiracies, and interrogating witnesses.                  "
Justifiable Homicide,2002,67, 
Born to Be Wild,1995,0,"                      Most of the chances for humor are downplayed in favor of a heavy-handed, sentimental effort.                  "

The Mangler,1995,27,"                      Somewhere between the over-the-top performances, Hooper's unique blend of unrelenting comic horror, and the sheer weirdness of it all, The Mangler urges our viewership along for the duration of its runtime.                  "
Mortal Kombat,1995,45,"                      The wonderful (and practical) use of a limited budget, the film's phenomenal production design, and exquisite cinematography, and the admittedly terrible application of CGI.                  "
Othello,1995,68,                      Laurence Fishburne does one helluva job portraying the famous Moor straight out of the pages of Shakespeare.                  
Outbreak,1995,59,"                      Maybe not my favorite Petersen film, but it’s pretty compelling when it’s showing the horrors of contagion and how futile we are to nature.                  "
Restoration,1995,71,"                      …Restoration may not match up with Tremain’s book, but the observation of the corrupt world around Downey Jr’s character is refreshingly bitter…                  "
The Show,1995,80, 
Something to Talk About,1995,39,"                      The humanity is spread around with a quirky, generous hand, reason enough to distinguish this quiet, low-tech comedy in a season of big-bang juvenilia.                  "
Under Siege 2 Dark Territory,1995,34,"                      There's still entertainment to be had as Seagal goes through his usual counterterrorism routines, but here he uses guns more than his famous hand-to-hand combat techniques.                  "
The Adventures of Pinocchio,1996,35,"                      Scary live-action version has violence, guns, and monsters.                  "
Alaska,1996,23,"                      The vistas are spectacular and some of the suspense is effective, but the story is egregiously dumb, and the polar bear becomes so improbably resourceful that one fully expects it to fly everyone home and then script the sequel.                   "
The Big Squeeze,1996,43, 
Bogus,1996,41,"                      It's a shame, given the promising teaming, that the two stars don't get to interact until the last one-third of the movie.                  "
Broken English,1996,82, 
Carpool,1996,13,                      This attempt at entertaining knockabout comedy is a perfect example of Hollywood dumbing down and treating its audience like idiots.                  
Carried Away,1996,64, 
Chalk,1996,60,"                      Chalk is an exciting rediscovery-a crackling, nervy gem from what now seems like a very distant era.                  "
City Hall,1996,56,                      Director Harold Becker captures the political rhythms of the big city and keeps the rather complicated plot comprehensible. But audiences need to pay attention; this is not a by-the-numbers urban thriller.                  
Crash,1996,64,"                      If you're in the market for a thrilling ride, buckle up and head for Crash.                  "

Executive Decision,1996,63,"                      For moviegoers, the nerve gas might be no more irritating than the film's preposterous plotting.                  "
Extreme Measures,1996,56,                      ...a solid medical thriller that's lamentably been forgotten in the years since its 1996 theatrical release.                  
Eye for an Eye,1996,8,                      John Schlesinger is one of the finest directors of our movie past. It is sad that this is all he apparently can find to direct.                  
The Break,1997,67,                      It's a political thriller from which all the politics has been carefully spooned.                  
Ghosts of Mississippi,1996,43,"                      I've grown increasingly restive at such films as Mississippi Burning, A Time to Kill, and Ghosts of Mississippi... All three films celebrate the heroism of white law officers in prosecuting racist killers.                  "
Hamlet,1996,95,"                      This edition, directed by and starring Kenneth Branagh and released in 1996, is one of the most well regarded of such works.                  "
Hellraiser Bloodline,1996,24,                      ...a progressively underwhelming endeavor...                  
Jerusalem,1996,80, 
Last Man Standing,1996,39,"                      With its hazy, sepia-tinged lens, and helped along by the film-noir style narration, this Prohibition-era action-packed crime drama has the look and feel of a classic.                  "
Lost Highway,1997,69,                      Peels away the pulp trappings and runs almost entirely on film noir’s foundational fears.                   
Michael,1996,36,                      Director Nora Ephron knows her way around feel-good.                  
Michael Collins,1996,78,"                      Leaders who help bring about huge change are often gifted with a charisma that will spur a nation into action. Liam Neeson, as Irish revolutionary Michael Collins, has just that.                  "
My Fellow Americans,1996,47,"                      With two of the screen's best comedic actors, a script that crackles with wit and surprise, and perfectly tuned direction, My Fellow Americans scores a bull's-eye.                  "
The Nutty Professor,1996,64,"                      This cruder, more sexualized update of the Jerry Lewis classic is also more consistently funny and imaginative.                   "
Sleepers,1996,73,"                      Levinson knows how to make a movie. He keeps it compelling throughout, and although it runs 2 1/2 hours, Sleepers offers no room for catnaps.                  "
Space Jam,1996,43,
Striptease,1996,14,"                      The image’s occasional yellowish field combines with the reverse motion to denaturalize Frye’s figure: he seems trapped on the surface, in the emulsion.                  "
The Substitute,1996,42,                      ...an appealingly larger-than-life premise that's employed to watchable yet consistently (and disappointingly) hit-and-miss effect...                  
Surviving Picasso,1996,35,                      Hopkins’ portrayal of [Picasso] is no less than brilliant.                  
Thinner,1996,14,                      A wretched excuse for a horror movie and a flat-out disgrace on every level.                  
A Time to Kill,1996,68,"                      The performances are strong, the issues provocative.                  "
Two If by Sea,1996,13,"                      This film will do nothing to displease the ever-growing legion of Sandra Bullock fans. It will, at the same time, add to the public recognition of Leary. It will, however, make no waves. It's merely a pleasant-enough time-waster.                  "
Absolute Power,1997,56,"                      A Clint Eastwood film that lays out the ingredients for a well-made political thriller, but its lack of intrigue and calculated effect throws the mix into an unfinished sketch. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
Addicted to Love,1997,55,                      ...an oddball premise that's employed to mostly underwhelming effect...                  
Anna Karenina,1997,26, 
Austin Powers International Man of Mystery,1997,73,                      Mike Meyers’ parody of classic James Bond movies and various 1960s copycats like Matt Helm and Derek Flint careens from gag to gag with such pop art color and energy that you don’t really mind that it misses the target so often.                  
The Avengers,1998,5,"                      However delicious the film is, the story isn’t involving enough and the action is rather pointless. While there is a great deal of humor, it often comes at the wrong moments and rarely is it on par with other spoofs.                  "
Boogie Nights,1997,93,"                      Made in the shadow of Paul Verhoeven’s much-maligned Showgirls, even a quarter-of-a-century on Boogie Nights is an evocative, provocative triumph.                  "
Brother,1997,100,"                      Set in St Petersburg and dizzy with an unhappy mood, the film is gripping.                  "
The Butcher Boy,1997,77,"                      The Butcher Boy is a trip, all right, but one that I'm sorry I took.                  "
The Castle,1997,87,                      This timeless comic snapshot of suburban life Down Under remains absolutely un-budgeable from its perch as the most widely adored (and quoted) Australian film of all-time.                  
Conspiracy Theory,1997,57,                      Drollness tinges the panic and irreverence that go hand in hand with Mel Gibson; he plays crazy incredibly well.                  
Contact,1997,68,"                      If you’ve ever gazed at the sky in wonder and wondered “what if”, are a fan of the magnificent Foster (and who isn’t), or simply like first-rate storytelling, then seek Contact out.                  "
Dangerous Beauty,1998,68,"                      Only McCormack manages to breathe any urgency into a tale that takes far too long to escape the fate of too many films set in Venice, in which San Marco and the Grand Canal's gondola fleet overwhelm story and characters.                  "
Almost Heroes,1998,5,"                      Unfortunately, Farley's unintended farewell is hardly memorable.                  "

FairyTale A True Story,1997,58,                      A sugared but poignant account...                  
Fallen,1998,40,"                      Fallen is more of a cult film, one that seems to gain more fans each year, all falling under its wild narrative’s spell and unable to listen to a certain Rolling Stones song in quite the same way again.                  "
Fathers Day,1997,25,"                      It's a wonder that these stars couldn't produce a funnier result, even with the faults of a weak script and poor pacing.                  "
Fire Down Below,1997,14,                      An edited-to-incoherence yarn.                  
Fools Rush In,1997,34,                      Hayak's Latin roots diversify the music...the movie also makes good use of the Nevada-Arizona border at Hoover Dam.                  
For Richer or Poorer,1997,14,"                      Despite its Amish setting, this laborious comedy proves to be witless rather than Witness.                  "
Home Fries,1998,31,

Masterminds,1997,19, 
Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,1997,51,"                      Not quite among Eastwood’s best, but a very entertaining and well-made courtroom drama with some unexpected personality.                  "
With Friends Like These,1998,50, 
Mortal Kombat Annihilation,1997,4,"                      I barely managed to make it through Mortal Kombat Annihilation because the dialog is terrible, the story makes no sense and the kung fu action scenes are substandard.                  "
Most Wanted,1997,15,"                      Throughout the film, we know so little about Wayans' Marine Sgt. James Dunn that we might as well be watching a G.I. Joe doll execute maneuvers.                  "
Paradise Road,1997,43,"                      Paradise Road is a unique look back in both style and content, but its subject matter deserved more engrossing treatment.                  "
Phoenix,1998,50, 
The Swindle,1997,71,                      Most entertaining.                  
RocketMan,1997,20,                      A movie that should be sent to Mars - one way.                  
Rosewood,1997,87,"                      Undoubtedly a great movie could have been made of this still unhealed scab on the body politic. But ""Rosewood,"" John Singleton's film of these events, isn't it.                  "
Wicked,1998,20,                      ...a seriously tedious suburban thriller that wastes the talents of its admittedly impressive cast...                  
Seven Years in Tibet,1997,60,"                      If the film seems a little like a fairy tale, what can one do with the story of an Olympic skier who ends up as tutor to a boy-king regarded as a god?                  "
Soldier,1998,13,"                      Russell is quite suitable for a Terminator-like role, where dialogue is at an absolute minimum, physical intimidation is relevant, and action sequences are numerous.                  "
Spawn,1997,17,"                      If it’s meant to snare the uninitiated, I must say it failed to hook me.                  "
Speed 2 Cruise Control,1997,4,"                      This is probably as good a time as any to point out that Orson Welles scrounged for budgets all his life, yet studios routinely throw $110 million at crap like ""Speed 2.""                  "
Sphere,1998,11,                      It pays to be incredibly suspicious of a movie where nearly all dramatic tension is drawn from characters standing around bleeping computer screens and commenting on how bad things look.                  
Three Kings,1999,94,"                      It has a distinctive look and feel, an atmosphere of burnout and chaos; it launches at a high energy level and generally stays there. The buzz, however, wears off fast.                  "
Steel,1997,12,                      Reliant on a heavy formula of repetition and camp that's more obnoxious than cute.                  
Trekkies,1997,86,                      Why does Star Trek boast the most devoted fans of any franchise in television history? That question gets answered -- sort of -- in this entertaining documentary.                  
U Turn,1997,60,"                      Filmmaker Oliver Stone has infused U Turn with exactly the sort of over-the-top, less-than-subtle vibe one might've anticipated...                  "
Vegas Vacation,1997,16,"                      This was okay; nothing special, kind of amusing.                  "
Western,1997,80, 
Wild America,1997,29,                      It's decent family fare.                  
Wishmaster,1997,25,                      ...a seemingly foolproof setup that's employed to distressingly erratic effect by Kurtzman...                  
Woo,1998,10,"                      Pinkett Smith, who was so good in her supporting role in The Nutty Professor, is here little more than a mannequin for skimpy clothes.                  "
American History X,1998,83,"                      Some movies are considered a product of their time, but this is on another level. It's more like a product of the entire history of mankind. A history of war, of imperialism, and of superiority.                  "
The Bachelor,1999,8,"                      The Bachelor is humorous and entertaining, at first. Unfortunately, the jokes become cliché, and the plot becomes a bit unbelievable.                  "
Blade,1998,57,"                      Blade is an entertainingly macabre and excitingly staged action horror, with a propulsive energy...                  "
City of Angels,1998,58,"                      Everything the over-the-top Ghost should have been - stylish, endearing and, watching it now 23 years on, enduring - City of Angels' only disappointment is that it didn't make even more of the Cannes-winning source material.                  "
On the Run,1999,60, 
Eyes Wide Shut,1999,76,                      A film detailing how unsexual sex is and how sexy almost having sex is.                  
Firestorm,1998,12,"                      Hokey smoky. That just about sums up Firestorm, a not-so-towering inferno of action nonsense and overheated mayhem.                  "
Living Out Loud,1998,59,                      'Living Out Loud' presents the delightful surprise of Danny DeVito as a romantic lead. And he also sings!                  
The Lord of the Rings The Fellowship of the Ring,2001,91,"                      There's still an organic, made-in-Jackson's-backyard feel to some of the battle and character scenes.                  "
Lost in Space,1998,27,"                      The film easily plays on its title, because the acting, plot and many other aspects are truly “Lost in Space.”                  "
Major League Back to the Minors,1998,21, 
My Giant,1998,21,                      My Giant becomes strikingly incongruous with the circumstances of its making; in real life Muresan has racked up a high-profile screen credit.                  
Palmetto,1998,38,"                      The tone is inconsistent and baffling; if we’re meant to take the plot seriously, we don’t, and if it’s meant to be funny, it isn’t.                  "
Pleasantville,1998,86,"                      Tobey Maguire, Joan Allen and especially Jeff Daniels are all tremendous here, and Gary Ross gives it just enough of a personality to give it an edge. Don Knotts is also doing his thing here, which I appreciate.                  "
Practical Magic,1998,23,"                      Few films have such warmth and purity of heart, which are buoyed by its fabular storybook quality[.]                  "
Quest for Camelot,1998,45,                      Both the derring-do of this duo and the comic antics of their animal sidekicks (particularly a talkative two-headed dragon) will keep children entertained.                  
Rush Hour,1998,61,"                      Endlessly quotable and completely memorable, Rush Hour stands head and shoulders above most buddy-cop movies.                  "
Tarzan and the Lost City,1998,6, 
Wag the Dog,1997,86,                      ...a vitriolic comedy/satire that venomously assesses the lack of morality in the modern media and politics...                  
Wrongfully Accused,1998,19,"                      Several of the supporting actors take their parts somewhat seriously, which makes Nielsen's incredibly over-the-top performance just that much more hilarious.                  "
Zero Effect,1998,65,"                      The presence of Stiller may lead you to expect a light, quirky Gen-X spin on the detective genre, but it cuts deeper than that.                  "
Lethal Weapon 4,1998,52,"                      An outstanding finale to the series, proving that some forms of overkill never get too old.                  "
Analyze This,1999,69,"                      De Niro and Crystal make an effective comedy team, but overall the film misses its mark on more than one occasion.                  "
Bruno,2000,20,                      ... surprisingly affecting fable.                  
Why Do Fools Fall in Love,1998,52,"                      Drug use brings down teen idol; sex, violence, cursing.                  "
Cure,1997,93,"                      an effective, deeply unsettling thriller that continues to perplex because it refuses the kinds of restorative satisfaction normally supplied by that genre                  "
Blast from the Past,1999,58,                      Fraser’s lab puppy phase is still one of the most endearing modes of anyone in the modern studio system.                  
Pecker,1998,52,                      Potentially [John Waters's] most self-reflexive work.                  
Prisoner of Paradise,1980,82, 
Another Day in Paradise,1998,58,"                      Another Day in Paradise, Clark's sophomore effort, represents the closest he's ever gotten to making a mainstream film. The movie is Clark's vision of the outlaw lifestyle...                  "
The Confession,1999,40,"                      If, as directed by David Jones, The Confession is a bit sluggish, David Black's screenplay nevertheless pokes us in the eye with issues as sharp as spears...What this flawed but absorbing movie suggests is that all Sol Yurick's novels deserve a film.                  "
Arguing the World,1997,80, 
Mickey Blue Eyes,1999,45,"                      There are some nice comic touches here and there, usually involving the odd Goodfellas/Godfather reference. The rest is pure ham off the bone.                  "
Edtv,1999,64,"                      You'll have a good time watching ""EDtv""-- Howard is always at his best in comic mode, and he gives the film a cleverly cluttered look that suggests the experience of watching reality on multiple monitors.                  "
Rogue Trader,1999,30,                      Rogue Trader is a terrible waste of the talents of Ewan McGregor.                  
Driven,2001,14,                      Renny Harlin drives this film into the ground.                  
Crossfire,1989,87,                      Crossfire daringly address[es] anti-Semitism...                  
Ride with the Devil,1999,64,                      The acting gem in this two-and-a-half-hour epic is the hair-raising rivalry between Maguire and a feral young killer.                  
Fountainhead,1956,83,"                      The Fountainhead is by turns exciting, handsome, astoundingly awkward, fully committed, untowardly relentless, very strange, and a little creepy in its compulsive watchability.                  "
The Decline of Western Civilization Part III,1998,100,"                      The third installment of Penelope Spheeris's documentary series on subversive musical movements, released in 1998, is by far the darkest.                  "
Three Seasons,1999,78, 
Message in a Bottle,1999,32,"                      Costner has a free pass to be as lazy as he can possibly be, and the result is one of the most smugly alienating romantic lead performances that I can quickly call to mind.                  "
Training Day,2001,73,"                      The sly casting of the charismatic Washington, who comes with built-in righteousness cred, helps this rise above some ill-considered third-act twists and anticlimaxes.                  "
True Crime,1999,56,                      It's all wrong; Eastwood is even miscast.                  
The Scenic Route,1978,63,                      We leave the film feeling that these three characters have been speaking and explaining their lives to one another and us forever.                  
Surrender Dorothy,1998,60,                      Whatever happened to Kevin DiNovis?                  
Swing,1999,43,"                      Stansfield, in a relaxed acting debut, delivers a performance as robust as her soulful vocals.                  "
Whatever,1998,75, 
Jack Frost,1998,19,                      My least favorite Michael Keaton role                  
Three to Tango,1999,28,"                      Although sometimes amusing, 'Three to Tango' relies on a one-joke emphasis that wears thin early on.                  "
Little Men,1998,14, 
Two Hands,1999,75,"                      Darkly comical, with firecracker performances from all involved, ""Two Hands"" deserves its status as an Aussie classic.                  "
Austin Powers The Spy Who Shagged Me,1999,52,"                      The sexual innuendo is back and still largely effective, but the repetitiousness of jokes from the first film start to lose their hilarity.                  "
Any Given Sunday,1999,52,"                      A marvelous breakdown of football from all angles, so gloriously overwrought in a way that captures nearly everything about the sport that makes it such a strange, difficult, dirty, addictive monster.                  "
Strays,1997,40,"                      You can envision a spin on this that isn't so bad, only because there were 35 versions of this movie in the mid-'90s - the malaise of the thirtysomething man. Looking for the genre's natural endpoint? It's the one that invokes Ferdinand the Bull.                  "
Deep Blue Sea,1999,60,"                      Deep Blue Sea is overall a bit of a silly shark film, but it’s a really fun one with lots of action sequences.                  "
The Hole,1998,85,"                      Despite a strong premise, powerful visuals, and excellent performances, I could not even grasp what it was trying to say by the end.                  "
Lady Snowblood,1973,100,"                      More than just a bloody revenge movie, though it certainly is that, a number of thematic strands and political critiques run beneath pulp surface.                  "
The Woman Who Dared,1916,86,"                      The acting is of the very best, and the production, as a whole, reaches the highest standards of screen art In every relation. Beatriz Michelena Is happily cast, and gives an exceedingly well studied and distinctive performance.                  "
The Art of War,2000,16,"                      Even the mystery of the double and triple-crosses doesn't really matter; it devolves into a bullet-dodging, body-battering, scenery-demolishing collection of brawls.                  "
Eye See You,2002,18,                      One of those films that sat so long on the studio shelf that a maid had to periodically drop by to sweep off the cobwebs.                  
Lost Souls,2000,8,"                      Well-plotted, with a first-class group of actors and sure-handed direction by Steven Spielberg's favorite cinema-tographer, Janusz Kaminski.                  "
American Pie,1999,61,                      The tight writing and direction underpinning this very likeable ensemble chuckler nails every tacky joke and surreal sight gag with considerable aplomb.                  
Limbo,1999,72,"                      Sharply uneven, John Sayles' 12th film features many of his thematic motifs but the ambiguous ending is problematic.                  "
The Runner,1999,24,"                      The Runner is a semi-return to form for Cage, but not quite good enough.                  "
Angst,1983,100,"                      An underrated gem, Angst is a fascinatingly morbid exercise depicting the grotesque capabilities of the disturbed. Beautifully photographed, it's an eerie exercise and puts Kargl in a unique category of one title auteurs.                  "
Detroit Rock City,1999,49,"                      ...a briskly-paced, unabashedly larger-than-life comedy...                  "
Liberty Heights,1999,85,                      It's atrocious. Twisted sociology.                  
Romeo Must Die,2000,32,"                      Less star-crossed lovers, more impossible physics.                  "
Desert Saints,2002,29,                      ... wants to be forties noir and gets lost somewhere between triple crosses.                  
The Lord of the Rings The Return of the King,2003,93,"                      ... a blood and thunder finale that takes the viewer into a conflict of (quite literally) Middle-Earth shattering dimensions. If anything, Peter Jackson and his collaborators try to do too much with the final book of J.R.R. Tolkien’s fantasy trilogy.                  "
The Lord of the Rings The Two Towers,2002,95,                      “The Two Towers” highlights Jackson’s keen ability to convey to the audience an incredible sense of the mystical and magical. The world he and his teams place us in are rich with imagination and the fantastical.                  
The Haunting,1999,17,                      ...a good/bad movie that contains the ruins of an interesting film...                  
Body Shots,1999,11,"                      Awful performances, idiotic social commentary and one of the worse Rashoman narratives ever take away the pleasures of some raunchy sex scenes.                  "
Magnolia,1999,83,"                      Magnolia is unlike anything that Anderson has produced before or since and as such, a vital watch for anyone claiming to be a fan of the director's work.                  "
15 Minutes,2001,32,"                      An interesting, not to say timely, twist on Andy Warhol's fifteen minutes of fame theory. Unfortunately, the execution of the thrills doesn't live up to the film's conceit.                  "
American Movie,1999,94,"                      The hapless director's determination and passion are astonishing, and undeniably impressive.                  "
Osmosis Jones,2001,56,"                      It sometimes lets its imagination cut loose in a fun way. But a lot of the movie is just puns, body humor, jokes...but some of the parts, they do very well with it...                  "
Boiler Room,2000,66,"                      There were random racial slurs, the father storyline didn't pay off and the performances were really uneven.                  "
Rock n Roll Frankenstein,1999,60, 
Battlefield Earth,2000,3,"                      It remains, genuinely, the worst film produced this century, as of 2020, and it is hard to imagine anything taking its crown any time soon.                  "
House on Haunted Hill,1999,31,"                      Does everything a remake should do: take the concept of the original and do something new with it. The CGI is atrocious, but it's a campy, gory and fun time.                  "
Little Nicky,2000,21,                      This is no Wedding Singer.                  
Carnage,1984,25, 
Space Cowboys,2000,78,                      I’m not sure that a relaxed treatment of tense outer-space moments is the way to go. The last half hour — the climax we’re supposedly here for — is flat-out dull.                  
The Intruder,1999,50, 
Mercy,2000,17, 
The Girl Next Door,1999,91, 
Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon,2000,97,                      Ang Lee's dreamlike film transcends its hybrid roots; it's unlike anything you've seen before.                  
The Replacements,2000,41,"                      There isn't a football cliche ""The Replacements"" doesn't tackle, but its all-star cast and easygoing approach make it one of the more enjoyable recent sports comedies.                  "
Head Over Heels,2001,10,"                      Romance, pratfalls, grossout jokes in lame comedy.                  "
Saving Grace,2000,63, 
Final Destination,2000,35,"                      This clever twist on the slasher sub-genre is good, gory fun and features one of the best death scenes ever put on film.                  "
Next Friday,2000,21,"                      While outwardly amusing, with plenty of scatological and farcical gags, it is an example of the kind of diminishing sequel that the early 2000's would deliver in spades.                  "
Red Planet,2000,14,"                      Establishes an amusingly nasty pecking order once it reaches the surface and even morphs into ""Predator"" for a hot minute. But it generally bears the anonymous aesthetics of an assembly-line product and is the uglier of 2000's dueling Mars films.                  "
The Cup,1999,85, 
Whatever It Takes,2000,16, 
Rock Star,2001,53,"                      Capping off a not-to-be-missed soundtrack, real-life heavy metal musicians... add credibility to the film as they take to the stage as members of the Steel Dragon band.                  "
Swimming,2000,74, 
Winter Soldier,1972,100,                      The voices and faces of the Vietnam vets interviewed in the film give blunt testament to the tragic sameness of all wars.                  
Exorcist The Beginning,2004,10,                      One of the most pointless prequels of all-time.                  
Get Carter,2000,11,                      A truly rotten remake of Michael Caine's classic 1971 UK gangster pic.                  
The Cell,2000,45,                      Tarsem Singh's vision in The Cell is unparalleled. It's a truly stunning and gnarly piece of work.                  
Bait,2000,26, 
Miss Congeniality,2000,41,                      Here's Sandra Bullock doing what she has always done - playfully splashing about in the middle of the mainstream. Those who enjoy a little mindless diversion won't mind getting wet once again.                  
Two Women,1999,83, 
Malena,2000,54,"                      Malena poses as a bounteously endowed, ripe, curvy Italian mamma, but metaphorically it's an undernourished cadaverous Kate Moss of a movie.                  "
Ready to Rumble,2000,22,"                      This movie is absolutely absurd, even by wrestling standards.                   "
Soul Survivors,2001,4,"                      A horror movie without horror, a spook pic without spookiness and a metaphysical drama without the slightest spiritual tug.                  "
Best in Show,2000,93,"                      ...often feels much, much longer than its 90 minutes...                  "
Heaven,1999,60,"                      All there is to the film is the hook; take it away, and what's left is a rather uninvolving tale.                  "
Beyond the Ocean,2000,33,"                      Haunting, beautiful, and all too frustrating.                  "
Pay It Forward,2000,39,"                      The stickiest pile of moosh since ""Patch Adams,"" and it has a comparable tragic ending that invalidates the film’s message.                  "
Angel Eyes,2001,32,"                      A muddled film, part supernatural, part romantic drama, part urban thriller and not satisfying on any level.                  "
Proof of Life,2000,39,"                      Good story, but too violent for kids.                  "
Book of Shadows Blair Witch 2,2000,14,                      One of the key lessons of The Blair Witch Project that’s completely lost on Book of Shadows is that disorientation can take place only after some orientation is established.                  
Violet,2000,85,                      Devos knows just about how long to hold a mute static shot or hover over youth inhabiting suburbia to have resonance and depth. The 7 minute one shot ending is worthy of Antonioni comparison.                  
3000 Miles to Graceland,2001,14,"                      With his mean-stud swagger, brushed-back coiffure, scimitar-shaped sideburns and a wardrobe that reeks of white trash sartorial splendor, Costner certainly looks the part of a sneaky-snakey ex-convict with grand plans and a short fuse.                  "
Collateral Damage,2002,19,                      Just use brawn over brain in accepting the logical order of events in this film.                   
Divided We Fall,2000,90,"                      ""Divided We Fall"" is a vital reminder of the kinds of dramatic choices made by millions of peopled victimized by Nazis and traitors in a war that was fought at all costs.                  "
Summer Catch,2001,8,                      It's a movie that should have been called on account of boredom.                  
Audition,1999,83,"                      A film I’ve seen once and I’m not sure I’ll ever see again because it’s so effectively disturbing, which is exactly what you want with a horror film. I’ve never looked at piano wire the same way again.                  "
Prozac Nation,2001,28,                      Those of you who were waiting so impatiently for the release of this movie version of Elizabeth Wurtzel's chemically enhanced Weltschmerz will be as sorry as the film itself...                  
Queen of the Damned,2002,17,"                      'Queen of the Damned' is considered a bad adaptation, over-the-top silly, and just a poorly structured film in general. All are true. However, many, myself included, see it more as a disasterpiece, a guilty pleasure, a piece of 2000s nu metal nostalgia.                   "
Eisenstein,2000,64, 
Just Melvin Just Evil,2000,86,"                      Director Whitney chronicles a painful journey through his family's past to unravel a vicious circle of abuse, incest and molestation and their devastating effects on three generations.                  "
Exit Wounds,2001,33,                      This might be the last time a Steven Seagal movie felt like a real movie.                  
Come Undone,2000,78,                      Sébastien Lifshitz’s Come Undone is the most mature depiction of a young gay male’s romantic awakening I have ever seen.                  
Fat Girl,2001,74,"                      While hardly enamored with Fat Girl, I was fine with it until its conclusion.                  "
The Closet,2001,85,                      This witty film courageously takes on the corporate world in all its greed and prejudice. And wins.                  
40 Days and 40 Nights,2002,39,"                      Sure to be a hit with teens and 20-somethings, 40 Days and 40 Nights, while no great masterpiece, is nevertheless funny and worth the price of a bargain matinee.                  "
American Outlaws,2001,14,"                      Let's cast a lot of cute boys as the James/Younger gang. In between hold-ups, they can bicker about who's the cutest and, oh yeah, they can take their shirts off a lot.                  "
Swordfish,2001,25,"                      Swordfish is made with demonstrable skill and enthusiasm, and it's so improbable in its particulars that most viewers in the mood to do so will be able to kick back and enjoy it as shoot-'em-up entertainment.                  "
Funny Money,2006,43,"                      An old-fashioned screwball farce with a few amusing moments, just not enough of them.                  "
Charlotte Gray,2001,33,"                      There is velvety rich cinematography, an evocative score, beautiful period pieces and some captivating performances, but they fail to unite and do justice to the literary source.                  "
Devils on the Doorstep,2000,91,"                      Jiang Wen's deceptively daring film reduces the Japanese occupation to a farcical situation with two prisoners, and we're all the better for it...                  "
Big Trouble,2002,48,"                      Sharp, funny movie for high schoolers and up.                  "
Rollerball,2002,3,"                      Rollerball is an unbelievable bomb, but one of the most educational-revealing corporate desperation at its vulgar low.                  "
Juwanna Mann,2002,10,                      Cross-dressing sports comedy has lockerroom humor.                  
Into the Arms of Strangers Stories of the Kindertransport,2000,91,                      ... deserves the Oscar it won last March for best documentary feature...                  
Werckmeister Harmonies,2000,98,                      I will admit the pace of the film was a little slow for me but overall I liked the story and the slow evolution of the unrest in the city...                  
Our Lady of the Assassins,2000,78,"                      The tension of the inevitable pulls tautly at the lovers, like a mousetrap spring ready to snap at the slightest provocation.                  "
Hearts in Atlantis,2001,49,                      Anthony Hopkins uses his casual intelligence to deflect a dung-storm of sentimental hocus-pocus.                  
Heist,2001,68,                      ...Heist benefits substantially from a narrative bursting with surprising twists and plot developments...                  
Manic,2001,67,                      Powerful film packed with profanity and brutality.                  
The Isle,2000,78,"                      The Isle is sick, but it is not empty spectacle.                  "
Possession,2002,63,                      Possession is finally too truncated for material that wants to be a sinuous six-hour miniseries.                  
About Schmidt,2002,85,"                      The latest film by Alexander Payne (Election, Citizen Ruth) scrutinizes features of America's social fabric with a relatively sharp eye.                  "
Me Without You,2001,67,                      Writer-director Sandra Goldbacher's 2001 feature Me Without You... serves as further evidence for the kind of actress Williams was to become.                  
Murder by Numbers,2002,30,                      Average thriller that achieves its aim of moving star Sandra Bullock a few houses away from her trademark girl-next-door persona.                  
Rain,2001,85, 
Rhythm n Bayous A Road Map to Louisiana Music,2000,40, 
Death to Smoochy,2002,42,                      Rarely does something so tasteless on the surface produce such depth. I hope this finds its audience; this would bring the house down with the right midnight audience.                  
Love Is the Drug,2006,60,"                      Elliott Lester's uncommonly assured debut feature, doesn't just shame most other teen dramas; it stands above most recent American independent films of any sort.                  "
Avalon,2001,80,                      The techno thriller is more boring than thrilling.                  
City by the Sea,2002,48,"                      It all adds up to a moving film that may not be unforgettable, but it is memorable nonetheless.                  "
The River,1959,92,"                      On the whole, the casual narrative technique of its adapters is more interesting than either its story content or its characters. And its picturesque background... is more interesting still.                  "
Iris,2000,69,                      ...generally more of a showcase for several undeniably superb performances than anything else...                  
Barking Dogs Never Bite,2000,88,"                      It's a dark comedy in which Bong, in his debut, mixes genres and uses a vast economy of aesthetic resources to draw a very sharp social observation about unemployment. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
Mad Love,2001,48,"                      Every historical film, it seems, has certain requirements: galloping horses, characters swathed in yards of tapestry fabric, demure yet treacherous ladies-in-waiting. Mad Love has all that and more.                  "
Eight Legged Freaks,2002,47,"                      The production ultimately doesn't know what it wants to be, resulting in a mediocre attempt to revive big bug thrills and chills.                  "
Vampires Los Muertos,2002,20,"                      A great leading man is nothing with bad dialogue, an inept story, and terrible supporting cast.                  "
The Gospel According to Philip K Dick,2001,21, 
Haiku Tunnel,2001,60,"                      Not badly done, but overshadowed by the superior (and better funded) Office Space                  "
Renegade,2004,22,"                      I have no requirement that film genres, any more than literary ones, should be pure, but it's difficult to imagine that an enthusiastic audience for this stoners' western would comprise anyone apart from crystal-dangling deadheads.                  "
I Am Sam,2001,36,"                      Penn never goes over the top with his speech, ticks, hand gestures, and all-around physicality. He doesn’t act like a mentally challenged man, he behaves like one: there’s a big difference between the two.                  "
Urbania,2001,72,                      Shear never shirks from the horrors of gay city life--but he doesn't ignore the tenderness either.                  
Insomnia,2002,92,                      Nolan crafts an expertly balanced drama with a surprising emotional underpinning that transcends what it means to be a good detective thriller.                  
Gods and Generals,2003,8,                      Succumbs to turgidity. And...intentionally or not...conveys the impression that the film uncritically celebrates the Confederacy. [Blu-ray]                  
Rush,1999,71,"                      Though well-acted, well-written and well-directed, it's still an unpleasant watch that never gets beyond being routine.                  "
Bad Company,2002,10,"                      As the film begins to lose much of its momentum and forcefulness, it's nevertheless tough to rob Hopkins of an incredible screen presence.                  "
Dirty Deeds,2002,64,"                      Fun, watchable, enjoyable, forgettable.                  "
Wanderlust,2001,50, 
Steal,2002,29,                      ...a bunch of people in cars (and trucks and Rollerblades) chasing after one another.                  
Love Liza,2002,54,                      Love Liza's success can be traced back to Hoffman's uncompromising exploration of irreconcilable pain.                  
Starwoids,2001,80,"                      No matter how much you like Star Wars, the film will leave you feeling relatively healthy and normal.                  "
The Pool,2001,40, 
29 Palms,2002,0,                      Not a good date movie.                  
White Oleander,2002,69,"                      Director Peter Kosminsky ... is unfortunately not up to the task at hand, giving us a product one would expect to see on Lifetime, not one that requires payment for an admission ticket.                  "
Brooklyn Rules,2007,45, 
Dreamcatcher,2003,28,"                      If this is what Stephen King movies have disintegrated into, then it's time to pull the plug.                  "
Close Your Eyes,2002,46,                      Its solid horror pedigree is all the more enjoyable because it comes as such a surprise -- forgotten in a dusty corner and just waiting for the right fan to find it.                  
What a Girl Wants,2003,36,                      What a Girl Wants may be predictable but this comedy will never not be enjoyable.                  
Scorched,2003,20,"                      The comedy is extremely broad and there's a slight air of desperation to the whole thing, as if the film is trying too hard to be quirky and likeable.                  "
Talk to Her,2002,91,"                      Almodovar's unique vision creates a sensual, extravagant world of its own.                  "
Analyze That,2002,27,"                      Once again, Billy Crystal and Robert De Niro play off each other with successful, clashing comedic personalities.                  "
Meet the Fockers,2004,38,"                      It's an unimaginative comedy, with occasionally effective scenes interspersed with flat retreads of the original's jokes.                  "
Outside the Law,2002,86, 
Full Frontal,2002,39,"                      Clearly, a low-budget affair and, plotwise, a bit fractal. But I strangely like how navel-gazey Full Frontal ended up being...                  "
Secret Ballot,2001,83,                      I see Payami as creating a formal relationship between his audience and subject that encourages us to be open-minded: neither of the two main characters can be seen as all right or all wrong...                  
Millennium Actress,2001,93,"                      ... truth and fiction, time and memory, love and loss, all intermingle until the only way to get to the end of the story is not through the linear path but by jumping forward and backward and forward again as memory becomes the road we travel.                   "
He Loves Me He Loves Me Not,2002,71,                      Audrey Tatou is perfectly cast as Angelique.                  
Crackerjack,2002,100,"                      More subtle than his stand-up or television act, Crackerjack is an adult comedy, like Waking Ned Devine, that even your grandmother can appreciate the somewhat risque humour of.                  "
Mortal Kombat,2021,54,"                      Unlike previous entries hamstrung by the limitations of a PG-13 rating, this film makes full use of the R rating.                  "
The Phantom of the Opera,2004,33,"                      As I was sitting in the auditorium alone watching this film, I kept looking around hoping there was a chandelier above me getting ready to plummet to the ground.                  "
The Trip,2003,38,"                      When the film turns mawkish in the last reel, the tears are a welcome respite from the glib one-liners that substitute for character development in the first half.                  "
Austin Powers in Goldmember,2002,53,                      Even the outtakes during the end credits are utterly humorless.                  
Feardotcom,2002,3,"                      FearDotCom takes itself way too seriously, ultimately adding to the film's dreadfulness.                  "
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,2002,82,                      ...a watchable (and impressively faithful) adaptation that never quite becomes as captivating or engrossing as one might've hoped...                  
Ghosts of the Abyss,2003,80,"                      Cameron reconstructs life aboard in the shape of living tableaux of passengers and crew, seen in spectral mode, eating, drinking, dancing or promenading among the watery remnants of their vessel. It is done with finesse and, oddly, is deeply touching.                  "
Far from Heaven,2002,87,                      This is a masterpiece of a film that 20 years post release still looks and feels like an important piece of cinema.                   
Cherish,2002,51,"                      The mix of tones can be jarring, but it all has an odd charm.                  "
I Capture the Castle,2003,78,                      An overloaded script by Heidi Thomas defeats a fine cast that includes Bill Nighy...                  
Old School,2003,60,                      Each comedian's distinct personality and contrasting style of humor lends to a diverting onscreen partnership.                  
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,2004,90,                      ...a marked departure for the watchable yet thoroughly bland series...                  
Japanese Story,2003,68,                      Collette's pitch-perfect performance and the stunning evocation of the forbidding and beautiful outback make this film unexpectedly rewarding.                  
The Order,2003,10,"                      I didn’t mind ""The Order""; somewhere in there is an intriguing idea.                   "
The Crocodile Hunter Collision Course,2002,53,                      Basically a 70-minute version of the TV show.                  
Swing,2002,83,                      A deceptively straightforward film with enough grooves and riffs to charm even the most tone-deaf viewer . . . Gatlif's film has a brisk energy and bracing passion                  
Our Father,2002,93,                      The starkly elegant compositions underline the existential nature of the brothers' plight: it will be entirely up to them to make something of their lives.                  
Ballistic Ecks vs Sever,2002,0,                      I guess not every bad movie has a cult following in its future. Some of them are just kinda bad.                  
Wannabes,2000,19, 
Blood Work,2002,52,                      Mediocre crime pot-boiler from Clint Eastwood in actor-director mode.                  
The Dogwalker,2002,54,                      The Dogwalker is in many ways a dark comedy about a micro-slice of LA madness in the tradition of Laurel Canyon and Ellie Parker...                  
Final Destination 2,2003,48,                      Final Destination 2 is legitimately an excellent movie; it's a fun and suspenseful film that manages to improve on the original in every way while also standing entirely on its own.                  
Nicholas Nickleby,2002,78,"                      Pic separates itself out by hitting the humor as hard as the pathos, finding a nice contrast between the caricatures of the supporting roles and the dimensionality of the leads.                  "
Willard,2003,64,                      Glover is almost gleeful in the film.                  
Sympathy for Mr Vengeance,2002,53,"                      ...the same dramatic visual style and cruel plot twists, but the mechanical retribution is even more boring...                  "
The Foreigner,2003,0, 
Two Weeks Notice,2002,42,"                      Its utter prototypicality is tiresome, and its weird plotting and characterisation preclude it from gaining the simplified happy ending it proposes it has arrived at.                  "
The Event,2003,44,"                      Intelligent, moving, but annoyingly self-satisfied...                  "
Immortal,2004,43, 
The Big Bounce,2004,15,                      Missing: this movie's plot.                  
Prisoner of Paradise,2002,82, 
Raising Victor Vargas,2002,96,                      The work avoids a variety of clichés and attempts to take seriously its young protagonists' lives and dilemmas.                  
Broken Wings,2002,93,"                      ...reminiscent, in its gritty and sometimes unrelievedly grim aspect, of some of British director Mike Leigh's social naturalism                  "
Looney Tunes Back in Action,2003,57,"                      Winning and contenting and delightful, no matter how imperfect.                  "
Resident Evil Apocalypse,2004,19,"                      So the action — what we’re there for — is incomprehensible, and the story — what we’re not there for — even more so.                  "
The Ballad of Bering Strait,2003,67, 
Big Fish,2003,75,"                      Tim Burton's lone outstanding, heartfelt film of the last two decades may not seem like a natural fit with his horror-tinged oeuvre. But in some ways it's his most intimate, personal movie.                  "
Elf,2003,85,                      Elf stands tall with the feature being as funny today as it was in 2003.                  
Life Is a Miracle,2004,60,"                      Kusturica se repite a s mismo y entrega una alocada comedia sobre el amor, la locura y la guerra.                  "
Twin Sisters,2002,69,"                      Stamp collectors, this is the movie for you. For the rest of us, Lotte and Anna are nice but not very interesting characters,                  "
Phone,2002,50,                      Phone is at best a historical curiousity...it's not a movie that's much worth watching in any case.                  
Far from the Madding Crowd,1915,43,                      The picture tempo abroad is so entirely different from this country that it is rather hard to follow the story as it proceeds.                  
Matchstick Men,2003,82,                      Matchstick Men -- a nice strong balance of laughter and melodrama that envelops you like A Summer Wind.                  
Choice of Weapons,2002,83,"                      Hardly a masterpiece, but it introduces viewers to a good charitable enterprise and some interesting real people.                  "
Mystic River,2003,88,"                      Eastwood's film is rooted in a profound misreading, or more to the point, a profound ignorance of society and human relationships. His false and shallow premises lead the filmmaker to construct an unconvincing, fantastical drama.                  "
Secondhand Lions,2003,60,"                      A lovingly sweet tale. A positive tale. A tale of kindness and gentility. Does this even exist anymore? In the eyes of Tim McCanlies, it does.                  "
Second Best,2004,41, 
Thirteen,2003,81,"                      Given the room for platitude and cliche, the film's wholly genuine, gritty and from the heart.                  "
Freddy vs Jason,2003,42,"                      For a movie designed to be a silly and over-the-top celebration of two iconic franchises, FvJ hits more marks than it misses. Englund delivers his best Freddy since 87' and the cast of victims are fun albeit goofy bunch. Come for the carnage, not logic.                  "
Seabiscuit,2003,78,                      The greatest horse racing movie of all-time.                  
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,2005,88,"                      ...a woefully uneven installment that feels, for the most part, as though it should be a good hour shorter...                  "
The Sweatbox,2002,100,"                      There are story flow and coherence issues that may have given Disney pause about releasing (this). But there's also the ""We messed up and don't want to remember that"" element to it. Still, it's not a ""banned"" film as such.                  "
Two Friends,2002,100,"                      Emma Coles and Kris Bidenko deliver nuanced, ingenuous performances as polar opposites Louise and Kelly.                  "
Antibodies,2005,67,"                      In German with English sub-titles, the performances of [Wotan Wilke] Mohring and [Andre] Hennicke together with the visuals are strong enough that even were there not subtitles, one would know exactly what terror had taken hold.                  "
Birth,2004,39,"                      With turns of tragedy rather than suspense, Glazer conceived and executes an inspired and sensitive drama that deserves reassessment as a carefully considered, masterfully made film that finds a place in its viewer and lingers there like a haunting dream.                  "
Cellular,2004,56,                      ...a rather irresistible premise that's employed to briskly-paced and often engrossing effect...                  
Fakers,2004,38,"                      Fakers is pleasant, passable entertainment, even if it's all too lightweight.                  "
The Missing,2003,58,                      Blanchett and Jones are matched well as two idiosyncratic people. There's a symbiosis to their performances as stubborn loners. The filmmaking is competent but never thrilling.                  
Lucky You,2007,28, 
The Polar Express,2004,56,"                      While on paper everything about The Polar Express seems to point towards the feature being a disaster, the final product stays on the rails to become anything but.                   "
The Aviator,2004,86,                      Martin Scorseses epic biography of the life of Howard Hughes is his love-letter to the old-Hollywood bio-pic. This is high-style filmmaking wrapped up in a tormented hero whose soaring flights of greatness are matched by the mortal pull of his devils...                  
Stateside,2004,24,                      Well-acted but ultimately bland...                  
The Evil Within,2017,100,                      This film left me speechless and it really is something you just have to experience yourself.                  
Undead,2003,32,"                      In its zeal to be more than just a zombie film, it loses sight of what makes a zombie film work in the first place.                  "
A Certain Kind of Death,2003,100,                      Um olhar detalhado e curioso sobre uma jornada burocrtica e mrbida.                  
A Very Long Engagement,2004,78,"                      With detail crammed into literally every frame, you'd be hard-pressed to find a more imaginative film this year.                  "
Superman Returns,2006,74,                      The glossiness of the visuals and the faithfulness of the cast in mimicking their ’70s counterparts makes the film a fitting revisit to a meandering property.                  
Bodysong,2003,80,                      Remarkable for its beauty and its violence.                  
Cheaper by the Dozen,2003,24,                      My least favorite performance from Steve Martin.                  
Marathon,2002,50,"                      We need to endure rather a lot of amateurish filmmaking to get to the raw, important story that's being told                  "
NASCAR The IMAX Experience,2004,60,"                      Despite the occasional white-knuckle point-of-view shot, I never felt I was being pulled into someone else’s reality—and isn’t that the whole point of cinema?                  "
Memories of Murder,2003,95,"                      We should all know by now that Bong's stories are never just what they at first seem  to speak in a Parasite analogy, you have to go into the basement.                  "
The Legend of Leigh Bowery,2002,92,"                      ...a suitable tribute to Bowery, never shying away from the excessiveness and eccentricities that defined Bowery and his art and making a stand for why he was so important in the queer world.                  "
Blade Trinity,2004,24,                      Leave it to Parker Posey to be the best part of two major horror franchises' dismal third entries.                  
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty,2013,52,"                      I admire the film’s originality, and the thought-provoking twist ending, but daydream of a deeper director’s cut.                   "
Spartan,2004,65,"                      He'll always be writer first, but for a relentless entertainment with actual with wit and soul, Spartan may just be the best thing David Mamet has done, certainly the best he has directed.                  "
Wimbledon,2004,61,"                      I cared about the resolution of the film, and the closure for these characters.                  "
Constantine,2005,46,"                      A handful of scenes depicting the high temperatures on the devil's home turf are plausibly horrific, but the rest barely registers.                  "
Fahrenheit 451,2018,31,"                      Bahrani's heavy-handedness robs Fahrenheit 451 of its potency, which is unfortunate, as Bradbury's story proves achingly imperative today by reflecting how governments instill control.                  "
Raise Your Voice,2004,15,                      Made for tween girls.                  
Duma,2005,94,"                      Few filmmakers can get remotely close to matching Ballard's slugging percentage. He said what he had to say, never wore out his welcome, and exited on a high note. More than a few of his lesser-talented contemporary peers should follow his lead.                  "
Tell No One,2006,93,"                      The mystery deepens adroitly, and Canet's confidence in Cluzet shows as the actor carries the film convincingly and without a fault.                  "
The Box,2009,43,"                      this lush, intelligent, frustrating film is probably better for keeping the precise nature of its mystery intact; thats what makes The Boxs central metaphor sing                  "
Chrystal,2004,80,"                      A sometimes audacious, occasionally downright brilliant, always watchable work that somehow just misses being wholly successful.                  "
Criminal,2004,69,                      There's nothing stars John C. Reilly and Diego Luna can do to make you forget you're watching the same story.                  
Trauma,2004,29,                      Visually stylish chiller that falls apart because it's a mess.                  
Taking Lives,2004,22,                      Taking Lives nicks characters from other flicks without any shame.                  
Jailbait,2004,17,                      It's really not much fun watching the non drama of our hero Randy (Michael Pitt) staring at the walls and keeping the hands of the more brutish Jake from clawing up his skirt.                  
Deep Blue,2003,67,                      Stunning footage of aquatic life.                  
Nappily Ever After,2018,67,"                      Nappily Ever After is a movie that looks good on paper and tries very hard, but just misses the mark.                  "
Syriana,2005,73,"                      This movie is certainly not for all, or even most tastes. If you prefer something light, breezy, and uncomplicated, don’t even waste your time. It gets up in your face and under your skin and grows only more confrontational and damning as it progresses.                  "
Anacondas The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,2004,25,"                      Surprisingly, it takes more than 40 minutes before the anacondas actually ensnare their first trekker.                  "
One Missed Call,2003,44,                      At the movie's core is a mystery that simply isn't even remotely interesting...                  
Five Children and It,2004,63,                      Funny wish-granting story has some mild scariness.                  
Happy Feet,2006,76,"                      Steve Martin said it best, 'I'm getting Happy Feet!'                  "
Straight Jacket,2004,45,"                      Straight-Jacket's themes -- the price of staying in the closet, the pain of being an unwitting beard, the McCarthy witch hunts that destroyed lives -- are way too rich to merely get popped like champagne bubbles in a campy comedy.                  "
After the Sunset,2004,18,                      Unappealing characters and a dumb story. Skip it.                  
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,2005,83,                      Marrying extreme set design and sublime casting... Burton's film showcases his usual interest in gothic effects and the original Willy Wonka's psychedelia.                  
Collateral,2004,86,                      This was not quite Mann enough for me.                  
Four Christmases,2008,25,"                      Thanks to a satisfying performance by Witherspoon and Vaughn's dependable comic chops, Four Christmases is a modestly entertaining holiday film for the entire family.                  "
Jurassic World,2015,71,"                      The visual spectacle, the dinosaur fights, the theme park environment all work to immerse you in a really cool setting. It’s too bad the underwhelming story, narrative hiccups, and bland characters drag it down to passable but forgettable levels.                  "
Batman Begins,2005,84,"                      Batman Begins tansforms the superhero genre and transcends its limitations with a film that is a moving, emotionally involving, and exciting experience.                  "
Brothers in Arms,2003,69,"                      Basically a longer, less slick version of the official Kerry profile unveiled at the Democratic National Convention.                  "
Journey to the Center of the Earth,2008,61,                      Often feels like an excuse to exploit a famous title rather than present a sincere adaptation.                  
Where the Truth Lies,2005,41,                      A metaphysical whodunit                  
Kiss Kiss Bang Bang,2005,86,"                      Although the novelty of a protagonist whos aware hes in a noir thriller grows tiresome, the comic banter between Downey Jr. and Kilmer remains priceless for much of the film.                  "
Halloween,2007,28,"                      It may not be the standout Zombie was hoping for, but Halloween finds its own brutal identity along the way while still honoring the original it is based on.                  "
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,2007,78,                      ...slick and briskly-paced...                  
Campfire,2004,88,"                      Wraps up rather abruptly and a little too neatly, but Campfire still roars effectively.                  "
Touch of Pink,2004,37,"                      Touch of Pink maintains a touch of artifice, which makes for a thin plot with a solid message: the unremitting advance of courage over prejudice, reason over ignorance, and love over fear.                  "
Malice in Wonderland,2009,10,"                      While you might expect a cheap quickie designed to cash in on the Tim Burton feature ... Malice in Wonderland is actually an honest and at times intriguing updating of the classic set in modern times, in the cockney underworld of South London.                  "
Racing Stripes,2005,35,"                      here have been worse family films that have been in release in recent memory, but Racing Stripes still isnt good enough to recommend even at a discount price.                  "
The Rum Diary,2011,51,                      The debacles they wade through are often padded with drawn out escapades that end in depressing reality over riotous antics.                  
Shadows in the Sun,2005,43,"                      The filmmakers go to great lengths to create a sense of authenticity, to a fault. We are left to assume a lot about who is what and where they fit in                  "
American Pastoral,2016,23,"                      American Pastoral is oddly flat and uninvolving for the most part, despite the convulsions it represents.                  "
X Men The Last Stand,2006,57,                      All marvel and little substance.                  
Drum,2004,86,"                      ...a harrowing, enlightening venture where 'We live fast, die young, and leave a good-looking corpse,' sadly isn't just a throwaway line uttered early in a bar scene. It's an epigraph.                  "
The Place Promised in Our Early Days,2004,71,"                      This was the debut film of director Makoto Shinkai, and the high quality of the animation and his strength in using vibrant imagery to convey story comes alive in nearly every scene.                  "
As It Is in Heaven,2004,83,                      ... splits the difference between heartwarming small town comedy of an outsider bonding with eccentric inhabitants and spiky drama of the insular town...                  
Jindabyne,2006,65,"                      Subtle and understated, a meditation on morality, mortality and murder that escalates into a small emotional powerhouse.                  "
Zoom,2006,4,"                      The end result is really a film that more sputters than zooms, but survives mainly upon the strength of its committed cast with an obvious chemistry.                  "
Cry Wolf,2005,23,"                      So, despite occasionally mustering some intrigue, Cry Wolf remains a howling disappointment.                  "
Around the Bend,2004,28,"                      When traveling the American Southwest, there are bound to be many KFC locations around the bend to feed you along the way.                  "
Motherless Brooklyn,2019,64,"                      Motherless Brooklyn is an ambitious undertaking. It's a big-city story that champions the people versus the developers, an important, ongoing subject.                  "
Where the Wild Things Are,2009,73,"                      There's plenty of amazing, surreal imagery and a brooding atmosphere, but little magic brightens this fantasy world.                  "
Brothers,2004,89,                      Emotionally commanding.                  
Proteus A Nineteenth Century Vision,2004,28,"                      The problem with Proteus is that the issues tend to overwhelm the story, and one is never fully engaged in the narrative.                  "
Saints and Sinners,2004,64,"                      You may feel like you've seen this story before, but not for a very long time, and never so gorgeously filmed.                  "
Reeker,2005,54,                      An unusually dull slasher...                  
North Country,2005,69,"                      Charlize Theron, in nonglam mode, dominates this powerful drama about sexual harassment at a Minnesota iron mine in the early 90s.                   "
Wedding Crashers,2005,75,                      The perfect example of a flawed but ultimately entertaining film.                  
The King,2005,57,                      This is a religion-professing country that usually turns a cold shoulder to films with spiritual aspirations. The King has the very thankless task of doing God's work at the movies.                  
House of Wax,2005,27,                      Holding the movie up to a flame shows it can't hold a candle to its predecessor.                  
Samaritan Girl,2004,50, 
Mojados Through the Night,2004,80,                      Brings a human face to a controversial political issue.                  
Appleseed,2004,25,"                      It's an exceedingly brilliant combination of future shock set-up and old school moralizing, a deconstruction of what it means to be human rendered in tech tones so slick that you often forget you're watching a cartoon.                  "
The Diving Bell and the Butterfly,2007,94,                      The movie's overwhelming achievement is its evocation of a life and events without wallowing in any kind of pity or histrionic melodrama.                  
After Midnight,2004,60,                      Reveals an immense gift for storytelling that blends sentimental quirkiness with wry satire.                  
The New World,2005,63,"                      Snow drifts bleed into slight white flowers dotting branches, ladders lead toward the empty vast sky, men eat men, men betray and war with one another, and love exists...                  "
Woman Is the Future of Man,2004,83,"                      Whatever else it may be, the film is an unflattering portrait of this egotistical, self-important professional layer in South Korea, conformist but bullying.                  "
Action Jackson,2014,10,                      It is one of those films that take the romance-action-comedy formula and pushes it so many notches higher that you can't hear yourself think over the cacophony on screen.                  
Everything Is Illuminated,2005,66,"                      Rather than aiming to please, the film expects a certain patience on the viewer's part as it ambles and slowly shifts from an often forced quirkiness to a bone-deep melancholy. That change of tack proves worth waiting for.                  "
Gambit,2012,18,"                      Never subtle and always over-the-top, nothing about this unnecessary remake suggests anything but a routine and painfully dull ""madcap romp"" in need of a distinct personality driving the production.                  "
House of Boys,2009,50,                      Udo Kier shows up in a supporting role and gives everything a spirited turn.                  
Million Dollar Baby,2004,90,"                      The characters Eastwood plays are not answerable to anyone, except themselves. As long as they pull a long face, furrow their brows and look pained after the fact, they are permitted to commit any number of crimes.                  "
The Deal,2005,21,"                      The elaborate suspense revolving around the toxic mix of oil, money and politics that the media only ever seems to brush the surface, makes for heady viewing.                  "
Five,2003,70,"                      A film of great honesty, of evenhanded sincerity and genuine naivete, Five imposes upon us the notion of getting along with people, which is very pleasant in our times.                  "
The Guardian,2006,37,"                      A simple, predictable, and formulaic action flick.                  "
Sweeney Todd The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,2007,86,"                      Director Tim Burton does take an iconoclastic approach to the material: here is a musical where characters whisper rather than belting to the back row. Burtons approach, while unusual by musical standards, is precisely what makes the movie work.                  "
Firewall,2006,18,"                      Giving it your brain's attention is like putting your card in a gleaming ATM slot and then being told: ""Sorry, because of a fault . . . ""                  "
Last Holiday,2006,55,                      LL Cool J's performance is so out of control that it's the only entertaining thing about this film.                  
Poseidon,2006,33,"                      The rest is the usual, spectacle, but coldly served by a reluctant Petersen. [Full Review in Spanish]                  "
Watchmen,2009,65,"                      While Snyder has brought this “unfilmable” story to the screen in the best way imaginable, he still can’t entirely keep it from feeling a bit cramped even at 160 minutes.                  "
Tying the Knot,2004,89,"                      Traditional in form, peppered with commentary from academics, lawmakers, and religious conservatives, Knot makes up in sincerity what it lacks in style.                  "
Mrs Henderson Presents,2005,68,"                       Judi Dench is hilarious and heartbreaking as the title character in Mrs. Henderson Presents. Her deadpan delivery wrings belly laughs out of gay screenwriter Martin Sherman’s zingers, and she jerks tears on cue too.                  "
Breaking News,2004,79,"                      Johnnie To's direction is once more impressive, particularly the way he stages and shoots the action, taking full advantage of the narrow corridors of the building the gang has taken a stand in                  "
Final Destination 3,2006,43,"                      Wong and co- writer Glen Morgan have again carefully and craftily plotted their set pieces, encouraging the audience to search for clues in, and out, of the frame.                  "

Throw Down,2004,92,                      No matter how hard he fronts; Johnnie To is no Kurosawa.

Snakes on a Plane,2006,69,"                      A catchphrase, a marketing triumph, a hipster phenomenon. Fortunately, it’s also a slyly entertaining flick divorced from all that.                  "
Dreamland,2006,67,"                      As the mother of a preteen daughter who has dragged me to a number of teen movies, I was captivated by this strange mutant of a movie. There is skill here, and some poignant scenes that stayed with me, including a first kiss scene that's one of the bette                  "
Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince,2009,84,                      ...a for-fans-only entry within an often distressingly hit-and-miss series of films.                  
Princess,2006,57,                      All in all I am very impressed with the command and restraint Anders Morgenthaler shows with his movie.                  
Psychopathia Sexualis,2006,23,                      Manages to be provocative without being exploitative.                  
Infamous,2006,74,                      A big city socialite and raconteur meets the small town community reeling from the recent grizzly murders of a family of four in the dazzling and involving Infamous.                  
Domino,2005,18,"                      A bad movie..., almost repulsive. [Full Review in Spanish]                  "
The Ax,2005,80, 
3 Iron,2004,87,"                      Oddly, 3-Iron is a violent yet serene meditation on the transitory nature of human existence. A work of genuine poetry, it's a cinematic hole in one.                  "
Get Smart,2008,51,"                      Like a younger, more rigorous version of Leslie Nielsen in his Naked Gun prime, Carell demonstrated here why he had, at the time, a reputation as the funniest man in America.                  "
Short Order,2005,0,"                      There is pleasure to be had in the visual style and some of the performances, suggesting that Byrne the director has been ill served by Byrne the writer.                  "
August Rush,2007,37,"                      August Rush benefits greatly from a delightful cast and John Mathieson's transcendent, fantasy-like camera work.                  "
The Education of Shelby Knox,2005,86,"                      Shelby's education, or, better, her enlightenment, is a beacon of hope in a land of well-entrenched myopic moralism and withering fundamentalism.                  "
Hairspray,2007,92,                      Marc Shaiman and Chris Wittman's score sparkles and the film's production design and appearance remain faithful to Waters' vision of 1960's Baltimore.                  
A Million Little Pieces,2018,27,"                      The Taylor-Johnsons have made a well-meaning version of a story about addiction, but given what we know about James Frey, A Million Little Pieces doesn't feel like enough.                  "
Unveiled,2005,80,                      laudable labor of love                  
March of the Penguins,2005,94,"                      With sparse narration by Morgan Freeman, written by Jordan Roberts, and beauteous orchestrations led by conductor Jeff Schindler, Jacquet lets the magic of the penguins speak for itself.                  "
Little Man,2005,60,"                      While Conn's story is inherently compelling, it's pretty much ruined in the telling thanks to her unnerving choice to fill it with a twinkling piano-heavy score, florid narration, and trembling slow-motion.                  "
Basic Instinct 2,2006,6,                      ...settles for a downgraded remake of the first film...                  
Going Under,2004,17,"                      Much of the film's impact is thanks to the performance given by Rees, here handed a rare leading dramatic role.                  "
Real Steel,2011,60,"                      Distill 'Rocky' and 'The Champ,' add a dash of The Rumble in the Jungle, shake well and serve in larger-than-life rock ’em sock ’em robots. That’s basically what you get with 'Real Steel'...                  "
The Giver,2014,35,"                      As both an adaptation and a stand-alone film, The Giver is something of a mess.                  "
Alita Battle Angel,2019,61,"                      However simplistic the characters and often banal the dialogue may be, Alita: Battle Angel offers an escapist science-fiction showpiece that may not be high art, but it nonetheless offers an important component of the moviegoing experience: spectacle.

Abel Raises Cain,2005,86,                      A host of hoaxes far funnier than the best of Candid Camera!                  
Terminator Salvation,2009,33,"                      I liked “Terminator Salvation” and while it’s not everyone’s cup of tea, I think it has a place in the series.                  "

Gracie,2007,61,                      The reason these formulaic films work is they give sports fans what we want: a hard-working underdog we can root for and a sense that the sports we love have some deeper meaning.                  
Danger Close,2019,71,"                      That lingering whiff of unquestioning patriotism is an ugly scratch on its shiny livery but for relentless, meat-and-potatoes action you could do a whole lot worse.                  "
Volver,2006,91,"                      Beautifully shot, structured, and acted, Almodovar's film sees the past repeat itself, the dead come back to life, and the painfully concealed return to the fore.                   "
Lincoln,2012,89,"                      Lincoln is immersive and respectable, and one of Spielberg’s most disciplined undertakings as a filmmaker.                  "

A Bird of the Air,2011,30,"                      Unfortunately, the film itself never quite feeds off the quirkiness or the energy, and so it remains a pleasant but not a profound film.                  "
16 Blocks,2006,56,                      It's a satisfying piece of genre filmmaking and an underrated American crime story...                  
Blood Diamond,2006,63,"                      Each of the lead actors does good work here - although Jennifer Connolly's war correspondent must to have an unseen hairdresser traveling with he r- but in regard to the social and political content, Zwick seems to have bitten off more than he could chew.                  "
The Wicker Man,2006,15,                      Neil LaBute's knack for biting wit would seem like the perfect fit for remaking Robin Hardy's 1973 classic. Unfortunately what he delivers is an unintentionally funny failure.                  
A Sidewalk Astronomer,2005,67,                      A documentary that knows to sit back and listen as he expounds on a variety of subjects.

Room 6,2006,20,"                      There are a few scares here and there, but none of them are especially memorable, and the climax goes on forever.                  "
Wonder Woman,2017,93,"                      Wonder Woman is fierce feminist filmmaking at its finest, featuring a powerhouse poignant performance from Gal Gadot, a truly ravishing romance that harkens back to Old Hollywood, and an effervescent sense of earnest optimism.                  "
Good Luck Chuck,2007,5,                      Penguin lovers will be ecstatic.                  
Lady in the Water,2006,25,"                      Nothing works in this film; it’s boring and incomprehensible, laughable when it should be inspiring.                  "
The Mini,2007,50,"                      Overlooking low production values and shaky performances from unknown actors is one thing, but when you put together a comedy that isn't particularly funny, then we have a big problem.                  "
TMNT,2007,35,"                      As a film, it's curious. It feels like an intermediary story.                  "
42,2013,81,"                      While it’s not a perfect film, it’s yet another example of how this great sport is fertile ground for quality storytelling.                  "
Being Flynn,2012,51,"                      Despite all this, Weitz and his camera are infatuated with DeNiro, who is performing more than he is acting in a film that only he and the director don't understand is more suited to the latter...                  "

Generation P,2011,75,"                      Nonetheless, ""Generation P"" deserves to be seen by a wider audience than the one in its home country, a film that will undoubtedly earn its cult status over time by being serious about the cult part.                  "
Drunkboat,2010,23,"                      Not even Malkovich could save such a leaky film, one that never stays afloat long enough to maintain an adequate focus on the family issues it raises.                  "

Sharkwater,2006,79,                      Stewart's documentary is seldom less than compelling in its quest to raise international awareness about a situation that is threatening to put sharks on the endangered list.                  
Inside,2007,83,"                      ...it is only after the closing credits have rolled and your fists have unclenched that the film's ambiguities and irrationalities return, not unlike Dalle's creepy 'femme', to haunt you.                  "
Ciao,2008,25,"                      In Yen Tan's glacially paced movie (every shot is relentlessly symmetrical), the actors are squares in graph-paper compositions.                  "
Red State,2011,61,"                      Red State is one of Kevin Smith's best and smartest films, as well as his most nihilistic.                  "
Salute,2008,100,"                      A riveting, eye-opening documentary that, like Norman himself, is undoubtedly worthy of more attention.                  "
Beijing Taxi,2010,80,"                      Shadowing the ups and bunny-hill downs of three cabbies, Wang's documentary will entreat loads of audiences to get first hand-to-mouth evidence that a nation's prosperity doesn't turn every bean into magical stalk.                  "
Nine,2009,39,                      I adored this!                  
Murder Party,2007,100,                      The script not only ups the ante on horror film conventions but also pokes fun at youthful paranoia and insecurities.                  
Sanctum,2011,30,                      Doesn't surpass being a hypertrophied B movie. [Full review in Spanish]                   
Mr Right,2009,15,                      A patchy film.                  
Snitch,2013,57,                      A surprisingly slick and intense thriller but one with very little staying power.                  
Guerrilla The Taking of Patty Hearst,2004,89,"                      By rejecting the view of the SLA as folk heroes, Stone presents a compelling document of a misguided political movement that epitomizes the butt end of the protest movement come the mid-1970s.                  "
Hellraiser,2022,66,"                      As a society we must stop kink-shaming the Hell Priest, Pinhead, but as a critic I have some complaints with their latest movie.                  "
The Switch,2010,53,"                      The Switch does not aspire to the romantic comedy genre, but Aniston and Bateman have nice chemistry... pleasant insignificance.  [Full review in Spanish]                   "
Horsemen,2009,20,                      Cliched police procedural film.                  
The Fall,2008,62,
From Prada to Nada,2011,20,                      Everything about this cheery sit-com-type Jane Austen-meets Cinderella rom com is utterly predictable.                  
The Road,2009,74,"                      I still recommend The Road; just keep in mind that this is Cormac McCarthy's post-apocalyptic tale, not Richard Matheson's.                  "
Eichmann,2007,38,"                      Mr. Kretschmann holds your attention through each whining complaint and bland denial. His character may be banal, but his portrayal is the only thing that keeps you watching.                  "
Acolytes,2008,75,"                      When Edgerton's killer begins to toy with (Sebastian Gregory's) Mark, it's like watching a cat play with a mouse - it's sad but you don't really care. Let the cat have his fun...                  "
The Thing,2011,34,                      This prequel to John Carpenter’s 1982 horror classic manages to capture enough of the shocks and paranoia of its predecessor to be successful.                  
Black Butterflies,2011,69,"                      What kept me most engaged were the mostly strong performances from the cast, and the beautiful cinematography.                  "
Pineapple Express,2008,68,                      The quality of the content rises and falls like the ever present waft of marijuana smoke.                  
Invisible,2006,0,"                      The film looks as if it was shot in more than one day, but Watsein's experiment in terror is a futile one.                  "
The Legend of Tarzan,2016,35,                      The film’s faults center more around its inability to invigorate the franchise and surprise us with something fresh and new.                   
The Day of the Dead,2007,86,"                      There’s no doubt what Romero’s meaning is—and his movie remains potent not just because of the loving attention it gives to special effects involving throats being ripped out and heads being ripped off, but because of the question at its core...                  "
A Very British Gangster,2007,71,                      The dude with the unlikely handle of Dominic Noonan gets his story told to a lively rock beat in this stereotype-challenging drama.                  
Banished,2007,87,"                      In Zvyagintsev's second feature, a timeless tragedy unfolds in slow motion - but the viewer's patience is rewarded with exquisite painterly images, some unexpectedly rapid developments, and a truly bleak vision of human error and its consequences.                  "
Left Bank,2008,83,"                      Van Hees aims for lofty goals. The screenplay touches on everything from the ancient concept of Ouroboros to Greek mythology, to bringing Samhain into the mix.                  "
Black Swan,2010,85,                      A high-pitched affair that sometimes risks silliness and sometimes achieves it. The risk is important — the movie is nothing if not impassioned — but overall the film is too rigidly schematic to be truly wild.                  
The Amazing Spider Man,2012,71,"                      No matter how impressive a cast, no matter how moody the marketing, no matter what superficial alterations the film’s three credited writers make to the character, none of it can distract from the familiarity of Spider-Man’s origin story.                  "
Robin Hood,2010,43,"                      ... an origin story for the familiar myth with elements of class, royal politics, and the disillusionment of soldiers returning from the Crusades demoralized by a misguided quest.                  "
Nights in Rodanthe,2008,30,"                      Here, getting swept into the notion that love prevails over all else is just too much to take (which is certainly not a new idea from Sparks).                  "
Celebration,2007,100,                      Most fashion documentaries are pretty sycophantic. Not this one.                  
Billy the Kid,2007,82,"                      While the teenager is the film's focus, an assortment of personalities enters the picture in an atypical way.                  "
Back Roads,2018,53,                      Pettyfer's performance is deeply engaging...Hopefully he'll find a script that fits him a little better in the future.                  
Justice League,2017,39,"                      Diverting but not engrossing, expensive but cheap-looking, action-packed but not exciting, amusing but not funny.                  "
Total Denial,2006,100,"                      A film that, perhaps now more than ever, deserves more than our total denial.                  "
Taking Liberties,2007,83,"                      ""The most important film of the decade"", this calls itself, though ""most self-righteous"" might be closer to the truth.                  "
Fair Game,2010,79,                      Fine performances from both Naomi Watts and Sean Penn.                  
Sucker Punch,2011,22,"                      Sucker Punch packs a pretty strong wallop. I enjoyed a lot of it, but I wish someone had warned me that a lobotomy was going to be a major plot point.                  "
The Adventures of Tintin,2011,74,                      A fun time that the entire family can enjoy together.                  
Fantasy Island,2020,8,                      “Fantasy Island” does nothing to justify its existence. It’s just a blob of fairly interesting ideas pasted together and thrown out for consumption.                  
Hunger,2008,90,                      Michael Fassbender is phenomenal in Steve McQueen's impressive and captivating feature debut. [Full review in Spanish]                  
Sherlock Holmes,2009,69,
Army of the Dead,2021,67,"                      Army of the Dead is a touch too long, but thanks to aggressive action and a surprisingly touching father-daughter-focused story, Snyder’s zombie epic entertains.                  "
The Wolf of Wall Street,2013,80,                      ... A sprawling riot of bad taste and consumption — and tremendously entertaining if you’re in the right mood.                   
Between,2006,0,"                      It's not only unoriginal, but it's a ham-fisted attempt to re-use unoriginal materials.                  "
The Business of Being Born,2008,81,"                      The film is flawed in many ways, not least of which is its tendency to oversimplify the portrayal of hospital births vs homebirths... What the movie does well, though, is to offer a corrective to the mainstream narrative about childbirth.                  "
Vision,2009,83,"                      Von Trotta's film is competently made, with impressive lighting and design.                  "
Pele Birth of a Legend,2016,33,"                      The film's predictability is counterbalanced by a terrific score comprised of several styles of Latin music, colorful production design, lots of special effects, and some memorable plays by the child actors who portray Pelé.                  "
Alien Raiders,2008,100,                      What could have been a fairly rote monster movie gives us a level of suspense that you normally don't get for a film that comes in under the radar.                  
Straw Dogs,2011,43,                      It's a testament to the power of the story (Sam Peckinpah's adaptation of Gordon Williams' novel) that the 2011 remake is still entertaining despite its numerous shortcomings.                  
The Rental,2020,74,"                      The film gets it right where it counts most – it’s entertaining, it keeps you locked in, and it ends in a fun and unexpected place.                  "
Sex and the City,2008,49,"                      Sex and the City is both titillating and conformist. For three of the characters at least, conventional love and marriage apparently bring life's challenges to an end.                  "
Bull,2019,90,"                      Annie Silverstein’s passion for the material is seen in every detail and the dense, textured setting is brought to light in striking reality. You won’t find any sugarcoating in “Bull”. It’s all about real-life complexity and struggle...                  "
17 Blocks,2019,100,"                      Rothbart is an accomplished filmmaker in his own right and certainly takes great care to assemble this footage in a way that doesn’t shy away from the harsh realities this family has endured, but he also doesn’t seek to judge them.                  "
Hunted,2020,60,"                      Perhaps more would be forgiven if Paronnaud had delivered on the terror front, but aside from a few moments of body horror, there isn't much to sustain the average genre fan.                  "
Leftover Women,2019,100,"                      It gets pretty hard to penetrate beyond the superficialities of the relationships presented on screen. However, Joelle Alexis' editing achieves a certain balance despite the unevenness of the different sequences.                  "
Watson,2019,100,"                      Watson is a vivid storyteller and a charismatic screen presence, fully conscious of the power of media.                  "
Nomad In the Footsteps of Bruce Chatwin,2019,90,                      While Herzog is wholly committed to the wanderer spirit here ... his admirable travelogue also frequently gets lost in the twists and turns of its uneven course.                  
All I Can Say,2019,84,"                      Directors Danny Clinch, Taryn Gould, and Colleen Hennessy have sifted through hundreds of hours of footage to fashion something that allows for a sense of the person behind the rock casualty.                   "
Changing the Game,2019,100,"                       A film both provocative and inspiring, its a terrific way to kick off pride month.                  "
Lucky Grandma,2019,96,"                      Lucky Grandma serves as a showcase for the side-splitting acting skills of star Tsai Chin first and foremost, amusing audiences around the world.                  "
Martha A Picture Story,2019,100,"                      Further enhancing the many joys of this diverting documentary: Martha Cooper just happens to be a wonderful, open-minded, big-hearted human being. Long may she click away.                  "
Linda Ronstadt The Sound of My Voice,2019,89,"                      It's wonderful to hear the music, to be reminded of the width and breadth of Ronstadt's daring and talent.                  "
Slay the Dragon,2019,100,"                      If you've ever felt mistreated by the system and wanted to do something about it but not known where to start, this is an excellent primer.                  "
Trixie Mattel Moving Parts,2019,91,                       Its a must for Trixie fans as well as anyone who appreciates the struggle for art.                  
As Above So Below,2012,27,"                      Fulfilling its B-movie requirements with ample jolts and tension throughout, the low-budget production boasts a diverting storyline and some fun, cheap thrills for casual late-night viewers.                  "
The Promise,2017,51,                      Movies like Lawrence of Arabia and Reds had the ability to sweep viewers away with their passion and grandeur. The only sweeping to be found in this case will be by the theater employee tasked with removing spilled popcorn from the auditorium floor.                  
Sirens,2022,98,"                      Amid a revolution in the Middle East, friendship, love, and thrash metal clash in Rita Baghdadi’s spirited documentary. Rock on!                  "
The Little Things,2021,44,                      What exactly went wrong with Mr. Hancock’s ode to ’90s Hollywood crime thrillers? The Little Things is frustratingly bland.                  
Clean,2021,46,"                      Clean waffles between being a conventional action film like Death Wish (1974) and Scorsese's social parable [Taxi Driver, 1976]. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
Love Aaj Kal,2020,20,"                      This Love Aaj Kal is what is known as a""spiritual successor"" or ""spiritual sequel"", except that it is so godawfully boring, contrived and wannabe that it provoked some very unspiritual, unholy feelings in me.                  "
The Humans,2021,92,"                      The Humans is A24‘s scariest film of the year. One that does reveal the truth that no matter how we may appear on the service, true horror and hell is other people…                  "
Countdown,2019,26,                      COUNTDOWN is a bland techno-horror that relies too heavily on ineffective scares to get a rise out of the viewer. Boring and forgetful.                  
Promises,2021,100,"                      The ugly digital photography takes luster away from this film, but... it's a notable portrait of politics: resentment, greed, suspicion, envy, isolation, and maybe, in smaller doses, integrity, honesty, grace, and idealism. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
Grass is Greener,2019,100,"                      Let me be blunt, Netflix’s new documentary film, Grass is Greener, is a stand-out effort from filmmaker Fred Brathwaite, bringing a steady hand to a film that is as eye-opening as it is sobering.                  "
Famous,2021,100,"                      Regardless of what does and doesn't work stylistically, the most important takeaway is that even with all the chatter and supposed confrontations regarding #MeToo, there's still evidently so many more conversations to be had.                  "
Unhinged,2020,48,"                      Stay for Crowe, who gives a performance in Unhinged that’s like a deranged rhino, or leave for the anemic plot that stands for nothing.                  "
The Knight Before Christmas,2019,67,                      ...a fairly worthless piece of work that rarely lives up to the promise of its irresistible setup.                  
Guilty,2020,60,"                      [All] the good work is undone in the end. [It] implodes in the worst possible way, with a mix of grandstanding and wish fulfilment that renders Guilty unrealistic and illogical.                  "
I Am Here,2021,91,                      Seek this film out.

Breaking Surface,2020,100,                      Writer-director Joachim Hedén’s survival thriller Breaking Surface is a tense and heart-wrenching examination of sisterly bonds that are tested by a terrifying diving accident made all the more dangerous by the looming specter of unresolved family wounds.                  
Morgana,2019,100,"                      In a world where older women are told to be quiet and forget about sex, Muses is an icon, but Morgana gives her space to be a real person, too.                  "
Between Two Worlds,2021,74,"                      At least for two-thirds, the film is authentic and desolating, showing us the impotence of the women who serve those with means, and the mutual respect and solidarity born out of that workforce that doesn't allow for repose. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
Lost and Found,2019,73,"                      What a pleasure it is to discover a quiet, quirky little comedy like Lost and Found. In this Irish anthology of seven interconnected stories, the characters are refreshingly life-sized.                  "
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2021,93,                      Denzel Washington gives a thunderous performance in Joel Coen’s stamp on Shakespeare.                  
Cocoon,2020,100,"                      The coming-of-age tale presented by Cocoon is not an idealized one that bears no resemblance to real life, but one that feels authentic in its pain and exhilaration.                   "
My Little Sister,2020,94,"                      Cancer dramas come with their fair share of cliches, and this film is no different, but it’s saved by outstanding performances that keep us invested from beginning to end.                  "
Roger Waters Us Them,2019,86,"                      A something that tries to bring new people into the fold. As such things go, however, it is an undeniably well-produced example that will presumably blow the minds of those who watch it.                  "
The Exchange,2021,67,"                      It's a sweet reminder that your plans may not always turn out as expected, and that's not necessarily a bad thing.                  "
Helen,2009,44, 
Reflection,2021,95,                      Reflection is a great war drama for those who like slow cinema. It is also a contemplative experience for those who love a deep and multi-layered cinematic experience.                   
Shut In,2022,60,"                      ... recommendable primarily for some organically tense moments between engaging characters, well-realized by the performers.                  "
Blink of an Eye,2019,67,"                      Waltrip is warmly engaging though we only scratch the surface of what caused his losing streak, and the accident's aftermath.

The Maid,2020,67,"                      The Maid is an immensely satisfying, subgenre-blurring rollercoaster from start to finish.                  "
The Quarry,2020,43,                      With this film many of the best moments are spent watching and absorbing two wily pros like Shannon and Whigham work out a scene.                  
Cinderella,2021,42,                      It’s a musical without good songs. It’s a comedy that isn’t funny. It’s a romance that lacks spark. The biggest casualty is Cabello who has some noticeable charm and even a little swagger.                  
Witch Hunt,2021,61,"                      Witch Hunt skillfully balances sharp social commentary with sincerely shocking scares, making this a must-see for genre fans.                  "
All Quiet on the Western Front,2022,91,"                      Berger never gives us the luxury of a hero fantasy, a quest formula, or a sentimental turn. Every time we think we might find our way to some note of relief or inspiration, we are denied that comfort.                  "
The Prom,2020,54,"                      While Murphy’s trademark glossy, high-octane conceit is a feast for the eyes, the heart often goes hungry.                   "
Loro,2018,79,                      Paolo Sorrentino brings us to the question of how egomaniacal we are and how much entertainment we need to spend our short time of life. [Full review in Spanish]                  
Dangerous Lies,2020,24,"                      It all makes for a movie that is just engaging enough to keep you watching. It still can’t avoid all of the pitfalls that come with movies like this, but it does give a good effort.                  "
Love Me Tender,2019,86,                      A magical (and painful) story of survival. [Full review in Spanish]

On the Divide,2021,100,"                      Shot over seven years’ course, the film gives voice to staff, volunteer, and clients on both sides of the ideological fence as their conflict grows even more heated.                   "
Shepherd,2021,72,"                      A well crafted tale of terror. The cinematography is stunning and the sound design and score help to create an ever-increasing sense of isolation, disorientation and dread.                   "
Bullet Proof,2022,29,                      … a self-aware slab of bloody-minded fun that doesn’t outstay its welcome.                  
Atlantics,2019,96,"                      The metaphor-rich imagery speaks to many of the feelings at the heart of Diop’s film – loneliness, betrayal, an ever-present longing. But they also convey a silent rage towards the many injustices vividly portrayed throughout this haunting tale.                  "
Mirage,2019,75,"                      Barely surviving its absurd length, this movie feels like a ton of genres mixed into a clever idea that suffers but works. [Full review in Spanish].                  "

Adam,2019,74,"                      Arriving following the backlash transgender drama Girl received upon general release earlier in the year, Adam is a great argument for letting trans people tell their stories.                  "
Summer of Changsha,2019,14,                      [Summer of Changsha is] a maudlin piece of fake deep psychodrama that doesn’t even have the good sense to entertain. Changsha is a film that hardly establishes the goodwill it works so hard to erode over two very long hours.                  
Selma,2014,99,"                      The majority of the movie serves as a forceful and unflinching reminder of the faith and courage shown by Martin Luther King, Jr.                  "
The Gateway,2021,51,"                      It's better to rip the Band-Aid off right away: A lot doesn't work with this movie. It's described as a crime thriller, but it lacks on the thrilling part. The story is pretty simple and doesn't do a whole lot to hook viewers in.                   "
Family Romance LLC,2019,74,                      It subtly mixes drama with documentary to offer an illuminating look at the disillusionment of a postmodern society trapped in the culture of the simulacrum that falsifies human bonds. [Full review in Spanish]                  
The Gangster the Cop the Devil,2019,97,                      Action-packed thriller from South Korea about partnerships and competition in hunting a killer; a perfect film from Lee Won-tae apart from a few clichés.                  
Blind Mountain,2007,87, 
The Captain,2019,75,"                      ...[a] hair-raising, high-in-the-sky action thriller. Lau's action-adventure spectacle that feels as unapologetically loose and unrestrained as a defective seat belt.                  "
Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains,2019,100,                      Alarmingly accurate in all... technical decisions. [Full review in Spanish]                  
Marry Me,2022,61,                      Lopez and Wilson may not be the most obvious on-screen couple. But both deserve a ton of credit for what they manage to do in “Marry Me”. They take this utterly ridiculous concept from a mostly formulaic and predictable movie and actually make us care.                   
First Love,2019,98,"                      Every time Miike could go completely off the rails, he reins himself in, pulling back where barging ahead would make this an even more memorable (if messier) experience.                   "
The Dark and the Wicked,2020,91,"                      I can't think of another American film propelled by such razor-sharp and hopeless fatalism, but there will be more.                  "
The Pickup Game,2019,80,"                      This isn't just an educational tool, though it functions perfectly as such; it should be watched by everyone. I know quite a few of my college friends could've used a viewing.                  "
Ghost Stories,2020,33,"                      If only Ghost Stories had more shock and rattle written into its four segments, it would have given the crows something to crow about.                  "
Noise,2012,83,"                      Much emphasis has been placed on the sound design, ably created by Emma Bortignon, but after a while, the constant sounds irritate and detract from the story.                  "
The Lost Girls,2022,13,                      The ambition cannot be faulted. But it’s marred by oh-so-many flaws.                  
The Surrogate,2020,95,                      It’s a lightweight treatment of some serious issues that can border on antic sitcom-style contrivance. But the performers are expert...                  
Dakota,2022,22,"                      For a family film with after-school-special vibes, it lands exactly where it should.                  "
Ghost,2020,100,"                      Ghost ultimately haunts the viewer with tight dialogue, brave character development, and powerful storytelling that gives you just enough of each before the explosive final act.                  "
Lillian,2019,75,"                      This all culminates in the film's final ten minutes becoming an utter slog that is almost entirely separate from everything else we've experienced, which leaves a sour taste.                  "
Argo,2012,96,"                      Affleck has not only reminded us that his best performances come when he’s in control, but that he’s also a considerable force behind the camera.                  "
Sensation,2021,13,"                      A sci-fi film that made no sense, as it tells a weird tale about people with enhanced senses.                  "
Gemini Man,2019,26,"                      Will Smith and Mary Elizabeth Winstead are both talented performers, but their skills are unable to save Gemini Man from copious, unintentionally bad dialogue.                  "
Antigone,2019,96,                      Sophie Deraspe shows the enduring vitality of eternal themes with this modern adaptation of the Sophocles play.                  
Land,2021,69,"                      Robin Wright’s directorial debut, Land, is an exercise in stoic ambivalence. The problem is her film tips its hand too early and often; leaving little for its audience to care about and hang onto through the picture.                  "
Skin,2019,76,"                      Skin is more interesting when it chooses to film violence frankly, to face the complexity of life without naive or well-intentioned apriorism. [Full Review in Spanish]                  "
The Father,2020,98,                      An act of empathic genius.                  
Work It,2020,85,                      Work It is a zippy teenage romp about chosen family.                  
French Exit,2020,64,                      Indie darling Azazel Jacobs’s film is a strange mix of causticity and ambivalence                  
Coolie No 1,2020,0,"                      ""What is ... is what?"" says Raju in his nurse avatar - an apt description of this endeavour as well as the larger misguided attempt to remake old favourites.                  "
memORIA,2016,100,"                      Memoria is a poignant and troubling film, but it rarely telegraphs its shots and treats its young subjects with a slightly removed concern.                  "
Bullied,2019,100,                      You can tell from watching Bullied that it is clearly a deeply personal film.                  
The Outsider,2018,17,"                      The Outsider is needlessly cruel, dour, and slow. No amount of brooding from a handsome leading man can save it.                  "
The Black Godfather,2019,100,"                      Excellent docu on showbiz legend, lots of cursing.                  "
Influence,2020,78,                      Cool yet blistering...                  
Poltergeist,2015,29,                      Why did we need a “Poltergeist” remake?                  
Halloween,2013,28,"                      It may not be the standout Zombie was hoping for, but Halloween finds its own brutal identity along the way while still honoring the original it is based on.                  "
Expired,2022,43,"                      It looks great, layering a vaguely sci-fi sheen on present-day locations. But it's so undercooked that everything feels oddly vacant.                  "
Strange World,2022,74,"                      Strange World isn't close to being a classic Disney movie. The film is very enjoyable, but not really memorable.                  "
Survive the Night,2020,13,                      A thriller that’s so unsure that the majority of the film is spent in daylight.                  
The Outsider,2019,50,"                      ... scores points as a well-mounted, traditional Western that should please anyone looking for a fix of old-school moral justice...                  "
Amsterdam,2022,33,"                      A rather boring film that, behind the curtain of political conspiracies, mixes genres uselessly and seems to be the product of a disjointed assemblage at the service of seedy characters who only spend their time talking nonsense. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
Madame Claude,2021,20,"                      A faux-twee period drama ... that all too readily trades in shallow, banal desires without presenting any profound affection or an ounce of sincerity.                  "
Force of Nature,2020,8,"                      Personally, I liked this film better when it was called Hard Rain starring Morgan Freeman and Christian Slater, but not really.                  "
Chehre,2021,0,                      The whole thing is more tiresome than impressive...                  
The Garden of Eden,2008,4,"                      Sex has never felt more repellent after watching Eden, a clumsy effort of eroticism and psychological gamesmanship that's utterly devoid of structure and feeling. It's an awful picture.                  "
The Subject,2020,60,"                      They're both powerful in their ways, but taken together, the very different dramatic techniques clash. Even so, The Subject remains worth seeing...                  "
Becky,2020,72,"                      Becky is a breezy blast and a gnarly genre gem that horrifically turns the plot of Home Alone on its head, with terrific turns from Lulu Wilson and Kevin James.                    "
The Contractor,2022,44,                      ...the picture’s slow-but-steady descent into irrelevance is triggered by a generic and rather bland midsection...                  
RocknRolla,2008,60,                      Guy Ritchie's hugely entertaining Lock Stock-reloaded...                  
Censor,2021,89,                      A dark and disturbing debut horror... Prano Bailey-Bond is the real deal in terms of talent... clearly a huge fan of the genre she draws upon influences from the time such as Argento and Ferrara.                   
An Unquiet Grave,2020,70,                      This may come as a pleasant surprise.                  
Bliss,2021,28,                      “Bliss” feels like something that sounds really good as a concept but that doesn’t quite pan out on screen.                  
Blithe Spirit,2020,28,                      “Blithe Spirit” isn’t without its charms and their are some laugh-out-loud moments of sly dialogue and slapstick humor that really work. But there’s still the feeling that the movie misses an opportunity to be more.                  
The Descendants,2011,87,                      It deals with some weighty subject matter in a real and thoughtful way. It shows glimpses of greatness even though it’s brought back down by some poor creative direction...                  
Black Box,2021,94,"                      For me, this is a fascinating look into a crash investigation and all of the hard work it entails. That we are also presented with a good mystery, too, is a big plus.                  "
Spiral,2021,37,"                      If you are asked to play a game with Spiral, just politely decline and go on your way. It might be time to call Game Over on our friend Jigsaw.                  "
Lair,2021,29,                      Lair succeeds with its female-led possession story but fails with the flat adjacent flat subplot.                  
Armageddon Time,2022,75,"                      Gray's first digitally shot film and, as it happens, the first time I’ve liked one of them...                  "
Defiance,2008,59,                       It doesn’t take many risks and it never strays too far from the more conventional survival movie path. But it’s a very well made film that captures the look and tone of the period.                  
The Mighty Macs,2009,47,"                      It's a story that inspires with pleasing and winning performances from the entire cast of this family-oriented, feel good film.                  "
Cold Skin,2017,48,                      Cold Skin is a beautiful dark film that feels like it unfortunately is missing something story-wise for it all to be absolutely fascinating. The acting and practical effects show great talent ...                  
Suspiria,2018,65,"                      This 2018 remake may not be as campy as its predecessor (those who have seen the 1977 original will remember the delightfully awful dubbing and insane lighting effects), but the raw morbidity of Luca Guadagnino’s Suspiria is still worth feasting upon.                  "
Home,2020,71,"                      The set-up teeters on the edge of cliche, but Potente and the fine cast keep it from toppling over by restraining the emotional torque of the material.                  "
The Other Me,2022,45,"                      It's not an easy film to decipher, but it does have a thematic and emotional dimension that could be satisfying for certain audiences. Full review in Spanish.                  "
The Dinner Party,2020,40,"                      This is a movie of such devilish and devious delights, more of a satire for the duration than a straight horror, making for a viewing that's fun and ghastly.                  "
After We Collided,2020,13,"                      After We Collided has very little to work with, and it shows.                  "
Paper Tiger,2020,80,                      Paper Tiger just stagnates in a pool of dour misery.                  
Shane,2022,100,"                      A celebration rather than an examination of Warne’s place in Australian culture, made for people who already like Warnie and want to like him more.                  "
CODA,2021,94,"                      ""CODA is sweet, sincere and genuinely funny in parts, and it’s precisely the kind of coming-of-age film that we should hope to see more of. ""                  "

The Story of Luke,2012,83,"                      Mayo and Pucci work together to create a portrayal of a young autistic male with authenticity and taste. Luke is not a caricature, nor is his condition understated.                  "
Piggy,2022,92,"                      One of those films that's so consciously extreme, disfigured, and shocking that it's almost impossible it'll generate a unanimous response, even within the same person. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
America the Beautiful,2007,72,"                      Touching on the tip of an iceberg, AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL takes you to the precipice with its thought provoking commentary on our society and then keeps you hanging on long after you leave the theater...                  "
The Stronghold,2020,50,"                      An ambitious but uneven policier that wants to be both knockabout buddy movie and action-packed drama with serious, contemporary themes                  "
Only the Animals,2019,93,"                      The connections between the characters go from unexpected to weird, inclusively bordering on perverse. [Full review in Spanish]                    "
The Father,2019,100,"                      The Father isn't a fully emotionally satisfying watch. But it is touching one, with plenty of enjoyable offbeat humor along the way.                  "
Love After Love,2020,67,                      An impeccably staged production that vividly evokes decadent high-society life in pre-war 1930s Hong Kong.

Awake,2021,24,                      “Awake” constantly teases us with its interesting ideas and you stick with it even through the rough patches in hopes of a satisfying payoff. Unfortunately the payoff never comes.                  
Limbo,2020,93,                      One of the greatest strengths of the film is the way that it beautifully balances tone. Sharrock skillfully manages to deftly move between comedy and tragedy... the result is something simultaneously heartbreaking yet uplifting.

Black Christmas,2019,39,                      Quite possibly the most offensive remake in the past decade.

Fighting,2009,39,                      At least there's humor found in desperation and comic relief in the quagmire of hustling.                  
Swan Song,2021,92,"                      Swan Song’s story may be simple, but Udo Kier’s colorful and charismatic character work makes this eccentric escapade worth a watch, along with its touching, life-affirming themes.                    "
Another Girl,2021,86,"                      The dialogue is sharp, without being ostentatiously witty, and the plot builds to an abrupt and shocking unexpected climax.                  "
The Prince,2014,0,                      The greatest effort seems to have gone into getting the look of the fight scenes correctly in an otherwise bland film.                  
Maria Chapdelaine,2021,90,"                      With a systematically languid, parsimonious rhythm, sometimes so contemplative that it makes the last stretch wearisome, but yet, it never nullifies the power of its visual strength and composition...                  "
A Bunch of Amateurs,2022,100,"                      It’s as entertaining as you could wish... At the same time, it doesn’t sugarcoat its rich melancholy.                  "
Megan Is Missing,2011,60,                      Although Megan is missing is not a perfect film it does have some special qualities that makes it stand out and I really enjoyed it.                  
My Tender Matador,2020,100,                      A very fine adaptation of a treasured book. [Full review in Spanish]                  
Love Child,2019,100,                      Director Eva Mulvad follows the family everywhere and over the course of years. Her camera captures all from video chats with friends at home to Mani having a meltdown.                  
A Sun,2019,95,"                      The family drama's subtlety and care don't mesh well with the crime drama, which feels underbaked. The lack of energy in the even-handed direction doesn't help, either. The family drama does work... thanks to the strong performances of the cast.                  "
365 Days,2020,0,"                      Come for the simulated bumping and grinding, stay for the ridiculous drama, stilted acting, hilarious soundtrack, and laughably offensive ideas about male and female desire.                  "
The Sleepover,2020,67,                      It will take a healthy amount of inner dexterity and strength not to utilize Netflix’s new fast-forwarding policy during The Sleepover.                  
The Human Factor,2019,96,"                      The elements explored are of great interest, and the layers peeled back are revealing in a way that illuminates an arduous process that's fascinating to explore.                  "
Mimi,2021,25,"                      MIMI is a wonderful, heartwarming film that takes on a really complex topic and treats it in a lighthearted, yet always honest and touching way.                  "
Long Story Short,2021,50,"                      Good lead performances and the gift of scenic locations does not lift the screenplay from the underlying problem of its tricky premise nor its flat, strained humour                  "
Threshold,2020,85,"                      Young and Powell demonstrate that you don’t need a huge budget to tell an interesting story, and that sometimes ingenuity and fortitude can go a long way.                  "
Lone Survivor,2013,75,"                      Lone Survivor’s major saving grace is that it never resorts to actual flag-waving, but enough pro-military overtones subsist in the material to consider it an effective recruiting video.                  "
The Wait,2016,73,                      “L’attesa” is a challenge. It requires patience and a willingness to look beyond a mere surface impression.                  
The Crimes That Bind,2020,67,"                      Slow burn and impressive Argentinian drama about a woman determined to support her son, no matter the price; and who also sees her maid through a legal trial of her own.                  "
Sweetheart,2021,100,"                      This modern update of a familiar teen holiday romance movie stands out for its honest portrayal of social awkwardness, sexual anxiety, and living as a young queer person.                  "
Shanghai,2010,4,"                      Perhaps the greatest mystery this film never solves isn't why Shanghai fell, but rather how such a magnificent cast was ever swayed to climb aboard.                  "
The Task,2017,100,"                      The movie is a tesseract made of mirrors, implicating and absorbing all who see it, erasing the boundaries between viewer, artist, and subject.                  "
Knocking,2021,79,"                      ""Knocking is gripping, and yet the suspense is so mundane it’s almost boring. But Kempff knows what she’s doing. Each time the audience might be inclined to drift, she pulls them back in, feeding new morsels to the line.""                  "
Run,2019,81,"                      A fast and furious tale of life, love and forgotten dreams... the Scottish film of the year.                  "
Ultras,2020,60,"                      Count me out. I've sat through films nearly identical to Ultras at least half-a-dozen times in the last 14 years and they never really get much better, or much worse.                  "
Together,2021,71,"                      That it all works is down Dennis Kelly’s smart script, which throws in some surprising and unexpected twists, Stephen Daldry’s taut direction and the braveness of McAvoy and Horgan to just lay their emotions bare.                  "
Crossing the Line,2007,90,                      The vertiginous play of ideology and identity and the sheer strangeness of Dresnok's experience (as well as that of three other American defectors from the sixties) make this film absorbing; the glimpses of life in North Korea make it important.                  
Here Today,2021,47,"                      Crystal directs, co-writes, co-produces and stars in this well-intended yet strangely uneven dramedy.                  "
Domino,2019,32,                      Production issues were evident in Domino and the over-stylized pace kills any suspense it tries to build.                  
The Furnace,2020,89,                      A remarkable first feature film...                  
Lucky,2020,93,"                      Natasha Kermani's Lucky is a reflection-provoking thriller that surprises right from the beginning. Once we think we know what's going on, Kermani changes course. The whole cast is thoroughly riveting, especially Brea Grant.                  "
The Torch,2019,77,"                      Buddy Guy, the 85-year-old blues star from Pointe Coupee Parish, Louisiana, is the subject of two recent documentaries. The newly released ""The Torch"" is a better account of Guys marathon rise to fame than last years oddly stilted PBS documentary.                  "
Night Drive,2019,100,                      It's a bumpy ride with the two leads having great chemistry together.                  
Pig,2021,97,"                      A rarity. One waits for a proverbial wink to let us know that we're experiencing a strange joke of a film. But the wink never arrives, and once we realize that this is a serious movie, we reach unthinkable dramatic levels. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
Into the Deep,2022,17,"                      The eventual reveal and the “action” borders on laughable, making our interests sink to the very bottom of the sea.                   "
Breakthrough,2019,62,"                      The script is sexist and bordering on misogynistic. Sadly, this film brought out my inner feminist.                  "
Border,2018,97,"                      The mysteries of Border reveal themselves slowly from here, but each one ratchets up the film's stakes in a delightful manner.                  "
Student Body,2022,50,"                      Student Body is not a perfect film, but I think that it will serve as a capsule to recognize future artists.                   "
Blaze,2022,92,"                      BLAZE is a powerful, captivating and beautifully directed film about coping with trauma and the art and production design are truly out of this world!                  "
Long Weekend,2021,67,"                      Overall, this film fits its title. Relax, enjoy the vibe and be grateful for a pleasant evening at the movies.                  "
Inside the Rain,2019,86,"                      In the end, Inside the Rain mostly succeeds thanks to its empathetic message for those who struggle with mental health and of course, Rosie Perez.                  "
Killers,2010,10,                      Killers is a provocation.  [Full review in Spanish]                    
Alice,2022,29,"                      Alice‘s scattershot screenplay causes storytelling stumbles here or there, but Keke Palmer’s persistently persuasive lead performance (somewhat) steadies the ship.                  "
Nocturne,2020,62,"                      Thematically, [filmmaker Zu] Quirk and her production team have created a very pleasingly atmospheric film with Nocturne.                  "
The Silent Twins,2022,67,                      Smoczynska’s skill at guiding the eye and capturing the moment can only take this story so far.                  
Fatal Affair,2020,18,"                      Giving the best performances they could given the content that they were provided, the glaring plot holes and predictable twists and turns depended too heavily on the backs of these actors.                  "
Kandisha,2020,78,"                      Kandisha herself becomes increasingly terrifying as her plan for revenge expands, but it's the horrors of the immigrant experience that rest at the heart of the film.                  "
All Hands on Deck,2020,100,                      This spirited road movie by the director Guillaume Brac takes flight when its young protagonists are stuck in place.                  
Saving Grace B Jones,2009,14,"                      A sadly muddled mess that never comes close to settling on what type of film it's supposed to be, and more importantly, what it's supposed to be about.                  "
Next Door,2021,70,"                      Agile and entertaining, a psychological torment, somewhat half-realized, particularly where it could've delved deeper into the two faces of a man who could have it all, [the film] still accomplishes a resoundingly sincere debut. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
Playground,2021,100,"                      The director builds a labyrinth of conflicting feelings, betrayal, resentment, the power of guilt, and the possibility of reconciliation, to lucidly and tenderly achieve this magnificent portrait of childhood. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
Mars,2010,86,"                      Mixing mumblecore with science fiction is original, but the resulting film demands more than it delivers                  "
Boys State,2020,95,"                      An extremely well edited piece of non-fiction storytelling... We might be losing faith in politics but thanks to Boys State, the state of the union between politics and film is as strong as ever.                  "
Between Us,2012,50,"                      Between Us is Edward Albee's classic play ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"" regifted in new wrapping paper.                  "
Paddington,2014,97,                      There is so much I loved about the movie.                  
The Nest,2021,80,                      The Nest sets the scene but it doesn't go anywhere.                  
Clear Blue Tuesday,2009,20,"                      A film that meditates upon post-9/11 psychology without an urgent sense of purpose or even an empathetic voice to guide us through the event's gnarl of grief isn't simply mediocre, it's dishonorable.                  "
The Elephant in the Living Room,2010,83,"                      A documentary about America's thriving exotic-pet subculture, The Elephant in the Living Room keeps its feet firmly and patiently planted in the OH-MY-GOD-PEOPLE-GET-A-GRIP camp, without losing sight of its subjects' humanity.                  "
Press Play,2022,65,"                      Press Play isn’t in the same league as Capra’s masterpiece, but it’s a modestly engaging and handsomely packaged diversion.                  "
Noise,2008,58,"                      Could have and should have been a demented little gem, but as it is, it's just a muddled, sloppy, and often incoherent little rant about New York...                  "
Blue Bayou,2021,75,                      Blue Bayou supplements its social message with a sentimental yet sincerely stirring story anchored by touching turns from Justin Chon and Alicia Vikander.                  
Boiling Point,2021,99,"                      They say that if you can’t stand the heat, get out of the kitchen. Bringing Boiling Point up to the pass, writer-director Philip Barantini proves he is worthy of a seat at Chef’s table.                  "
The Novice,2021,93,                      The plot might not win awards for originality but Hadaway’s direction and Furnham’s performance ensure The Novice will make Varsity.                  
Behemoth,2021,20,"                      The narrative just grinds on unpleasantly but artlessly -- except for those computer-generated nasties. They deserve to be in a better film, one that doesn't rely so heavily on them to work, and then doesn't work anyway.                  "
Wolfgang,2021,86,"                      In the 1970s, being a chef was a blue-collar job.  The owner of a restaurant might be known, but not the chef.  Food in the United States was fairly terrible (think TV dinners).  Puck changed that, and this documentary shows how.                  "
The Pit,2020,50,"                      There are a lot of ideas swimming around in The Pit, but most of them aren't arranged well enough to demand your attention.                  "
Broadcast Signal Intrusion,2021,69,"                      [the film] keeps the audience in the dark as much as it does its protagonist... The viewer inevitably grows more entangled in James’ investigation, and by extension becomes complicit in his increasingly erratic behaviours.                  "
The Ravine,2021,0,                      Reveals itself to be approximately four different movies by the time the story reaches its laborious and manipulative conclusion.                   
Supernova,2020,90,"                      Few films in recent history have moved me quite like Supernova, a sensitive drama starring Stanley Tucci as one half of a gay couple who is slowly but surely succumbing to dementia.                  "
Breathe,2009,93,"                      The drama rises on the rich performances of its two leads ... Neither girl is unsympathetic, which makes the ending of Breathe as sad and as startling as it feels inevitable.                  "
Paydirt,2020,20,"                      A lightweight and forgettable film about double-crossing deals in the desert, from Christian Sesma.                  "
Seance,2021,46,"                      Seance is not good on paper and even worse on screen, perhaps Barrett should stick to just doing what he does best.                  "
ANIMA,2020,100,"                      The world of Anima could easily exist in a universe, somewhere between Metropolis and THX 1138 -- evoking the underlying angst about capitalism and technology's sway over both society and the individual.                  "
Departure,2015,87,"                      Beautifully shot in a stunning location, the characters' behaviour somehow make the place ugly, serving as a stark reminder that a place is only as beautiful as the people perceiving it.                  "
Sex Appeal,2022,57,"                      Funny, sincere, and perversely sweet!                  "
Heart of the Sea,2015,42,"                      As the tale unfolds, told within another tale, it becomes clear that this is also about narration and narrators, unreliable and otherwise.                   "
The Pact,2021,79,"                      Neumann doesn't mine the complex possibilities and dramatic layers that Blixen, the tyrannical and temperamental writer, was known to possess. Something similar also happens with the film itself, too contained in its preciousness and academic formality.                   "
And Everything Is Going Fine,2010,91,"                      Letting Gray tell his own story seems a little loosy goosy, but [Soderbergh] strikes a beautiful balance of raucous hilarity and heartfelt reflection that make for quite a raw, honest revelation of a troubled, but brilliant performer.                  "
The Voyeurs,2021,43,                      The Voyeurs is a “Hitchrotic” thriller that doesn’t know the meaning of the word “stop.”                  
Free State of Jones,2016,47,                      ...a well-made film that’s both gripping and informative.                  
Rise,2022,95,                      A slam dunk of a biopic.                  
Skin A History of Nudity in the Movies,2020,85,"                      There’s a compelling legacy attached to such an unusual subject matter, and the discussions brought up are engaging.                  "
Scream,2022,76,"                      Unlike the recent James Bond outing, Scream understands its essence and embraces it whole-heartedly.                  "
Dog,2022,77,                      The tone and themes are incongruent with the overall storytelling.                  
Jasper Mall,2020,88,"                      A touching portrait of small-town America in a period of evolution, where the formal social circle of town must adapt or die.                  "
The Seventh Day,2021,13,"                      Mixing the subject matter of The Exorcist with the structure of Training Day is a pretty intriguing starting place for a movie, but Lange unfortunately struggles at times to make the most out of these unconventional ingredients.                   "
Big Eyes,2014,72,                      Quirky bits a humor shake the tone up a bit and Burton does several things with his camera that hearkens back to some of his earlier films.                  
Burlesque,2010,37,                      The glory of what Burlesque does well outshines any mistake.                  
Morning Glory,2010,55,                      Morning Glory isn't trying to be Network or Broadcast News but it doesn't need to be because it's both fun and entertaining enough in its own right.                  
The Daughter,2021,100,                      Subtly yet directly touches upon one of the most basic human instincts and captures the emotional turmoil that comes with a pregnancy with the consistent detachment that characterizes the film. [Full review in Spanish]                  
Mayday,2021,51,"                      As far as badass women crushing the patriarchy films go, ""Mayday"" is a fun, fantasy ride.                   "
The Walk,2022,21,                      Taking a page out of history to remind us how far we have come as a society is an eye-opening and valiant effort by director Daniel Adams for The Walk.                  
The Girl,2012,53,                      A sentimental shift in the last reel of the film seems artificially designed to wrap up the story and demonstrate that a life lesson has been learned. It's when it's at its most contemplative that The Girl is at its best.                  
Here,2011,71,"                      [It] doesn't offer up a ton of narrative surprises, but there is plenty going on the screen to keep you engaged - and visually stimulated.                  "
Love Exposure,2008,91,"                      A film about being overwhelmed, as much as it's an overwhelming film, and it's the most excitingly exhausting kind of too much.                  "
Cadaver,2020,33,                      Director Jarand Herdal tries to tell a unique story but forgets to pack in any frights.                  
South of Heaven,2021,45,"                      The performances in South of Heaven - at least those of Sudeikis, Whigham, and Colter - are solid, if unflashy.                  "
Blood,2022,50,"                      Bradley Rust Gray’s blood surely ranked as the most notable failure of all, a lugubrious slice-of-life...                  "
Master,2022,74,"                      ""Diallo has a deft handle on the film’s tone and atmosphere, expertly creating the playground for her characters’ fears to manifest. But she never closes the loop on the narrative itself, leading to an unsatisfying and confounding end.""                  "
The Way I See It,2020,85,"                      ""The Way I See It"" produces image after image that has been ingrained in our collective consciousness, with each of Souza's works capturing a moment in time, and each in its own way, telling a story.                  "
Amelia,2009,20,"                      Earhart, a rebellious obsessive with an active distaste for societal convention, ends up feeling flat in practice.                  "
Downeast,2021,100,"                      Even though Downeast suffers from thinly-written supporting characters, the lead performances keep the film above water.                  "
Beast,2022,68,"                      For much of its slim running time, Beast does what it’s supposed to do, right down to the buzzy moments of silliness where it bravely, too briefly heads over the top.                   "
Noise,2022,100,"                      Although we are at all times searching for Julia's daughter, it's not always clear where we are or how we got there, which allows the film's momentum to flag repeatedly.                  "
Basmati Blues,2017,10,"                      I didn't know whether to be deeply offended or simply sit back and bask in the goofy, tone-deaf glory of Basmati Blues.                  "
Brothers,2015,43,                      Brothers is a film that plays emotional rope-a-dope with its audience.                  
Lay the Favorite,2012,18,"                      Broad, flat, lugubrious, the worst example of filmmaking that exists.                  "
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,2009,85,                      A well manufactured thriller.  [Full review in Spanish]                  
Uncle Frank,2020,77,                      Uncle Frank is sure to be one of Amazon’s future awards season players.                  
Wild Men,2021,86,                      A far more textured story than its first few minutes would suggest... funny and heartbreaking.                  
Green Lantern,2011,26,"                      Here's something green that I would not want to touch with a thirty-nine-and-a-half foot pole. No, I'm not talking about Mr. Grinch. I'm talking about the Green Lantern.                   "
Animals,2019,87,                      Animals ultimately celebrates the messiness of balancing relationships in your thirties.                  
Agnes,2021,67,"                      While the movie tries to be clever with its dramatic shift in tone and completely new direction, it ends up feeling like two different films connected by the barest of threads. Even worse, neither story gets any kind of satisfying ending.                  "
The Unseen,2019,68,"                      On the whole, Amaurosis is a uniquely painful experience whose emotional trauma lingers even after it's reached its end.                  "
Duplicity,2009,65,                      Tries to be too smart for its own good.                  
Luz,2020,43,                      There's enough gravitas and storytelling expanse to this well-crafted film to make its happier developments seem well-earned rather than mere viewer wish-fulfillment                  
The Man Standing Next,2020,84,"                      Overall, the film's involving period detail and simmering intrigue allow it to stand alongside those classic American political thrillers of the 1970s.                   "
Sex Drive,2008,45,                      Pretty much everything has been done before in teen sex comedies - and the creators here know it.                  
Beauty,2022,22,                      Dosunmu’s airless directing and Waithe’s thin script only amount to loud allegory that never goes anywhere and drowns out any compelling ideas that might be worth singing.                  
Lola,2022,100,"                      Deftly combining multiple well-worn genres into something new and fresh, LOLA is one of the most original and compelling science fiction films of recent years.                  "
To the Moon,2021,92,                      “‘To the Moon’ is the rare low-budget indie that delivers the goods across the board.”                  
The King,2019,71,                      Filmmaker Michôd delivers a slow-moving yet perpetually engrossing endeavor that benefits from its atmospheric visuals and surfeit of captivating performances...                  
The Lawyer,2020,86,                      Viewers will no doubt debate if the story theyve just seen is a romantic dreamor a total nightmare.                  
Death Wish,2018,18,                      The wildly miscalculated release of this film is only matched by its mindless aggression.                  
Accidental Love,2015,8,"                      Whatever group of filmmakers took over after Russell left the project, they didn't find a consistent mark at which to set their comedy dial, though most of the time, it's set to eleven, blaring in our faces.                  "
The Alternate,2021,75,                      The sci-fi thriller flexes its muscle in its storytelling simplicity rather than piling on the special effects.                  
Ida Red,2021,33,                      “Ida Red” doesn’t always seem sure of itself or of the best way to get to its fairly predictable end. But John Swab does a good job building a family dynamic that’s both interesting and believable.                  
The Falconer,2021,100,"                      Nothing in this is as fascinating as the falcon and what must be done to train her, and every detour included here was added to make the obvious and the inevitable direction the story turns in less obvious and seem less inevitable.                  "
Mass,2021,95,"                      A catharsis of four cylinders that traverses torturous paths from which anger, impotence and sorrow try to find a way through, or at least, a little light. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
Betrayed,2020,100,                      Another outstanding reckoning with how Scandinavian countries dealt with Nazis in WW2. Several scenes are vivid demonstrations of the full scale collaboration of the title.                  
The Retreat,2021,77,"                      Even though The Retreat is completely predictable in how the story unfolds, it's a horror movie that's very effective in creating suspense and conveying 'race against time' terror.                  "
A Thousand Cuts,2020,100,"                      Diaz was granted remarkable access behind the scenes of Ressa's fight for democracy, creating an insider's look which allows us to see past the journalist's formidable game face to reveal her moments of vulnerability, with which anyone can empathize.                  "
The Fight,2020,99,                      The tireless fight against injustice gets the documentary treatment in The Fight...a necessary account...                  
Spaceship Earth,2020,88,"                      If there is any scandal to report, it comes from none other than Mr. April Fool himself, Steve Bannon.                    "
Assassins,2020,98,"                      As with Ryan Fogels similarly embattled The Dissident, you leave this film with a sobering realisation of the strength governments have to silence opponents, as well as the frightening absence of consequences.                   "
High Tide,2020,77,"                      Razor-sharp and cold to the touch, “High Tide” ultimately reminds of Bong Joon-ho’s “Parasite” in its view of class and gender as veneers not just obscuring but abetting our primal impulses.                  "
Into the Deep,2020,100,"                      A great documentary that is incredibly difficult to watch. The story is incredible to begin with, the fact a documentary was filmed during the events is unbelievable.                  "
Spree,2020,67,"                      Spree walks a fine line, but is able to find the balance, and stand out as a well crafted and inspired effort.                  "
Summertime,2020,81,"                      The commentary may not always be profound, but the vibrancy felt in these situations maintains an electricity that is amusing to witness.                  "
Midwives,2022,100,"                      Snow Hnin finds grace notes of optimism to offset the bitterness of the film’s backdrop... it makes Midwives a thoughtful, empathetic and powerful insight into the region – and its women.                   "
Unrest,2022,75,"                      The momentum of originality in “Unrest” counters the sturdy, uncontested machinery inherent to how the city at its center functions as well as in other narratives, executed with equally impressive skill and strength yet wholly and gloriously disruptive.                  "
Time,2020,98,"                      The new Amazon Prime Video documentary Time is lyrical, uncomfortable, and beautifully done.                  "
The Disciple,2020,96,"                      If Disciple feels more personal than most, it is because its preoccupations are more noble than what it appears. The question at the heart of this artistic expedition is not the need to achieve greatness but the reason for doing so                   "
Frankenweenie,2012,87,"                      Burton has set aside his usual, increasingly cloying commercial drives to tell a story that means something to him.                  "
Masquerade,2021,13,"                      There’s a lot to admire about Masquerade, which certainly makes excellent use of the French Riviera, but its pacing, tone, and screenplay are lacking                  "
Belly of the Beast,2020,100,"                      Cohn does a great job of highlighted a horrendous injustice, demonstrating how this exploitation takes place and following the brave women campaigning for change.                  "
Prime Time,2021,53,"                      A stunning central performance does a lot to rescue what the film's screenplay lacks. While it's an occasionally refreshing look at a hostage crisis, ""Prime Time"" is unfortunately understated to the point of being nearly anonymous.                  "
Heaven on Earth,2008,67,                      I can sense the profound ambition that inspired Deepa Mehta to craft her drama Heaven on Earth. But her uneven film turns out to be deeply troubling.                  
Gunda,2020,98,                      Kossakovsky is respectful and achieves a harmonious and elegant narration. [Full review in Spanish]                  
After,2014,8,"                      Gaspersz embeds you with this family's struggles, and almost makes you care about what happens to them all in the end                  "
Chain Letter,2010,29,"                      Sure, it's an increasingly silly, nonsensical film... but with plentiful gore and brutal kills, Chain Letter is no less entertaining than a movie like See No Evil.                  "
Orphan,2009,58,"                      'Orphan' is very exploitative of unfair fears. But I feel this works to its credit as a proud B-grade horror flick, what I like to call top-tier low-quality films. It just so happens that it is also ingeniously crafted.                   "
Faith,2019,100,"                      Pedicini structures the movie as an oblique narrative rather than an exposé. And ""Faith"" is all the more disturbing for that.                  "
One for the Road,2021,67,"                      Baz Poonpiriya’s youthful voice jazzes up the typical Wong Kar-wai melancholy, making a delightfully feel-good movie speaking to the times.                  "
Framing Agnes,2022,81,                      For such a studiously artificial work... it is profoundly moving.                  
Jacinta,2020,100,                      A powerful story about the never-ending cycle of generational trauma and self-medication.                  
NY Export Opus Jazz,2010,80,"                      It is gorgeously photographed, the colors seem to pop right out through the screen, and all of the dancers perform at the highest caliber.                  "
Freakonomics,2010,66,"                      The limited time given to each of the short films means that there is little opportunity to get really down and dirty with the number-crunching, so that for every aspect that is fascinating there is an attendant frustration.                  "
Rage,2021,71,                      A very intense film about a man's wake up call when a brutal attack leaves him comatose and with deep emotional scars.                  
Resurrection,2022,81,"                      … stark, queasy, and horrifying …                  "
A Most Beautiful Thing,2020,100,                      Why is A Most Beautiful Thing must-see viewing? Because it is a message of hope when hope is needed most.                  
The Karate Kid,2010,66,"                      This Karate Kid does not surpass the original, but it is superior to those sequels.  [Full review in Spanish]                   "
Prime Mover,2009,55,                      Road movie is a truckin' waste of energy.                  
The Best Is Yet to Come,2020,80,                      The film has a few golden touches that are a bit too optimistic that take us out of the story. [Full review in Spanish]                  
Residue,2020,94,"                      Even on such a small scale, Gerima is able to craft a deeply intimate portrait that also feels expansive in its commentary.                  "
Without Getting Killed or Caught,2021,100,"                      Even if you've yet to hear of Guy Clark (or, any of the amazing musicians mentioned), Without Getting Killed or Caught is still an engrossing and engaging documentary.                  "
The Art Star and the Sudanese Twins,2008,86,"                      [A] dizzying and dazzling meditation on art, inequality and responsibility.                  "
Rogue,2020,64,"                      Rogue's lousy writing, poor casting, and crummy special effects impede what should have been a precise target.                  "
Dog Eat Dog,2008,20,                      It's not rattling the genre.                  
Cheerful Weather for the Wedding,2012,37,                      It's as politely dull as the generically benign phrase of its title.                  
Dune,2021,83,"                      A film is, at its core, a piece of entertainment. While cinema is also a fascinating and diverse macrocosm of art, films like Dune make the case that intermingling approaches to the medium aren’t always possible.                  "
The Colony,2013,20,"                      A post-apocalyptic survival thriller which looks great, but isn't as exciting as it should have been.                  "
The Longest War,2020,100,"                      A sobering, sad, and horrific overview of the United States war in Afghanistan.                  "
Undine,2020,89,"                      By keeping the waters surrounding her origins suitably murky, Undine manages to successfully swim the line between erotic thriller and dark fantasy.                  "
Nemesis,2021,20,"                      Not really a complete, coherent body of work, rather it feels like a bunch of scenes stitched together.                  "
Shithouse,2020,95,"                      It may have some technical flaws - weird cuts, awkward camera movements - but they're not enough to spoil the good acting and entertaining script. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
Silent Night,2021,43,"                      There's not much cheer, holiday or otherwise, in this formulaic British thriller that never gains much momentum as either a quick-witted comedy or a violent crime saga.                  "
Everybody Dance,2022,100,                      This is a touching and uplifting documentary ultimately about the power of artistic expression and why we all benefit from opportunities to learn an art form.                  
Funny Face,2020,69,                      The storytelling moves at a listless pace and never finds one invested in any of the stakes or motivations.                  
Isabella,2020,85,                      Piñeiro's cinema is based on the pleasure of the experience itself. [Full review in Spanish]                  
The Middle Man,2021,71,
Black Friday,2021,65,"                      It’s an entertaining premise and the cast are all onboard. That’s enough to keep your attention, but not enough to stick in your memory.                  "
Vengeance Is Mine,2021,71,                      The surfaces of Vengeance Is Mine are so modest that the film’s deep vein of emotional terror sneaks up on you.                  
Mother,2020,100,"                      ""Mother"" is a very hard film through its cruel realism, which could have been a great one with a few minor changes in the writing and the finale.                  "
Ottolenghi and the Cakes of Versailles,2020,69,"                      A diverting but ultimately unsatisfying 75 minutes, simultaneously too short and too cluttered to meaningfully explore all the fascinating implications it presents.                  "
The Witcher Nightmare of the Wolf,2021,100,"                      A striking 81 minute character study wrapped in mayhem and magic. Like all good animated stories, it uses bright colors, fluid movement and excellent scoring to showcase its worldbuilding and a cast of characters with quirks and unexpected complexity                  "
The Man from Toronto,2022,23,"                      It has its moments, but not enough of them to make up for the overwhelming feeling that we’ve seen all of this before.                  "
Sweet Thing,2020,89,"                      It's rare for a film dealing with such subjects to fall on the side of optimism, naively misty-eyed or not.                  "
Through the Night,2020,100,                      Limbal cinematically reimagines how we view and treat people who mother. The film delicately crafts with humanity and heart that only a child of a female caretaker would know how to share.                  
Uncle Peckerhead,2020,100,"                      The script is unending in its character-based humor. Combines the easy, summer-esque feeling of a road movie with the horror-tinged antics of the perfect fall film.                  "
Attraction,2017,36,"                      It's so four-quadrant in its attempts to be both gritty and funny, romantic and action-packed, that it never gets to develop significantly in any particular direction.                  "
The 2nd,2020,0,                      A cut-rate Die Hard.                  
Days,2020,96,"                      The meditative quality of Tsai Ming-liang’s Days is so serene, so calming, so capable of lulling one into a dissociative daze that it quietly sneaks up to fill you with overwhelming sadness.                  "

Relative,2022,100,"                      While some instances feel more organic than others, none are completely out of place conceptually and all end up providing another springboard towards subdued yet entertaining levity by way of communion or juxtaposition.                  "

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,2011,96,                      It's a satisfying conclusion to a great franchise.                  
Beyond the Fire,2009,11,                      It's frightfully sincere and the sex scenes are a whole new level of unconvincing.                  
Wildflower,2022,60,"                      A sweet coming-of-age story that dives into very thorny territory. The end result is mixed, making the film feel off-putting, problematic, and insincere.                  "

Ascension,2021,98,"                      The analysis is rich but more respected on an intellectual level instead of one that is genuinely moving, particularly as there isn't a natural flow to the pacing here.                  "

Gran Torino,2008,81,"                      Its characters find peace through acts of openness, understanding and sacrifice, and it is these arcs that allow the audience to feel a sense of cathartic peace ourselves.                  "
Red Snow,2021,75,"                      Red Snow isn't always subtle in its satire, but then it's also a lot more understanding of the sparkly Orlok fetishist than is the norm, even in horror-comedies.                  "
Camino,2008,50,"                      Though respectful and subdued when the story requires, Fesser's ironic touch manages to extract humour from a dire situation and in the process, skewer organised religion and its propagation of false hope.                  "
Rambo Last Blood,2019,26,                      I liked the setup of “Last Blood” more than the payoff.                   
Stardust,2020,19,"                      A nice idea, hampered by circumstance and execution. There will no doubt be many films made about David Bowie and the impact he had on the world. They do well to avoid Stardusts mistakes.                   "
City Hall,2020,98,"                      Even just taken as a portrait of Boston in the midst of what'll now forever be known as 'the moment before the pandemic,' it's a work of massive regional significance.                  "

Escape Plan,2013,50,"                      After the finale degrades into a violent shootout and leaves us dissatisfied, not even solid portrayals by Stallone and Schwarzenegger make Escape Plan anything beyond a very, very guilty piece of actionized entertainment.                  "
Hereafter,2010,47,"                      This movie leaves a lot it think about - however you wish to interpret it - it leaves it's mark, and doesn't finish when it ends.  [Full review in Spanish]                   "
Lawless,2012,67,"                      There isn't much dimension to these proceedings and not an inkling of greater meaning beyond the story at hand, but it’s such a well-made picture that one can hardly protest.                  "
Out of the World,2020,80,"                      In rationalising the madness of his hero, the director conveys a disappointingly simplistic and unconvincing black-and-white vision of the world where Léo's emo sensibility is revealed as truth.                  "
First Man,2018,87,                      I love that it makes its own rules when it comes to storytelling. This is what happens when a biopic doesn’t cater to formula or expectations. The results are magnificent.                  
Dead,2020,88,                      Our hero might be Dead on arrival but this film is alive and kicking and frightfully good fun.                  
Seeking Justice,2011,28,"                      In Seeking Justice, Cage is in unfamiliar territory as the bookish Will Gerard which lends itself well to Cage delivering one of his best performances in some time.                  "
Voices,2020,0,"                      The bare bones of Voices should work - they just don't. Instead, what viewers are left with is a lumbering, haphazard, uninteresting mess of a film that's far better left unseen.                  "
The Resort,2021,37,"                      The Resort offers a fright-filled mini-break, but ultimately fails to deliver a truly memorable time. Do not expect a glowing review on TripAdvisor!                  "

Brave,2012,79,"                      Merida becomes a rare kind of protagonist, whose lesson tells a rapt audience that defying customs is okay, as long as we take responsibility for our actions and consider the ones we love in the process.                  "

Ghost in the Shell,2017,43,"                      The presentation has been shaped to Hollywood specifications and robbed of its potential uniqueness, insight, or innovation.                  "
Monstrous,2020,60,"                      Well-acted by its two stars and written with deliberation and pace (by Shields herself, no less), this is a thoughtful character study and a slowly unfolding mystery - a more serious version of Creep, but without all the found footage and peachfuzz.

The Swamp,2020,67,                      Directors DiMauro and Pehme fully recognize that these supposed rebels-and Gaetz in particular-are bald-faced hypocrites who don't walk their own talk.                  
Deliver Us from Evil,2020,94,"                      Deliver Us from Evil misses a few of its beats, such as some emotional stakes it tries to inject too late in the game, but on the whole it's a straightforward, brain-off action romp with cool visuals.                  "
A Royal Affair,2012,90,"                      It's a thoughtful, delicate romance that deserved more recognition on its release.                  "
Sound of Noise,2010,96,                      It's the perfect musical for the Youtube Generation.                  
Sister,2021,100,                      [This] resounding appeal for gender equality and recognition deserves to be heard and seen.                  
Encounter,2021,57,"                      Ahmed is magnetic on screen. His physicality and energy telegraph a man tightly coiled like a spring, ready to snap at any moment, threatening a spark that could ignite a powder keg of violence                  "
Luca,2021,91,                      Luca is a charming film with a more relaxed Pixar style that’s made for the dreamers in all of us.                  
The Other Side,2021,33,                      You will forget about it while you're watching it.                  
Blessed,2009,85,"                      Unforgiving in its shrewd relentlessness, the cast is flawless as is the direction.                  "
The Strange Case of Angelica,2010,85,"                      A master class in cinematic formalism, from a man with a lifetime of knowledge and experience.                  "
River,2021,33,                      The film’s soundtrack is majestically augmented by a specially composed music score by Richard Tognetti.                  
The Old Ways,2020,95,
The Tinderbox,2022,71,"                      Although this account is serviceable, there isn’t anything new in it.                  "
The Assistant,2020,93,                      Writer-director Kitty Green expertly crafts a culture of fear that permeates every inch of the frame... and holds up a damning mirror to the film industry in this impressive and incendiary feature.                  
The Andorra Hustle,2020,86,"                      'The Andorra Hustle' is bone dry, but complicated number-crunching financial scandal is where all modern crime is now born.                  "
Bad Teacher,2011,45,                      What must be one of Cameron Diaz’s last great films...                  
Shirin,2008,80,                      A brilliant meld of Kiarostami’s experimental and narrative tendencies                  
Teza,2008,88,"                      The herky-jerky quality of the experience, exacerbated by writer-director Gerima's restless editing, makes Anberber's story difficult to follow.                  "
Unmistaken Child,2008,81, 
Help,2021,45,"                      The clear standout and the reason we keep watching is James, who gives an electrifying and volatile performance, one that hopefully promises more roles in the future.                  "
Madalena,2021,100,"                      While Madalena’s best feature is its excellent cinematography, the whole package presents a perspective fresh (if not entirely satisfying) on a culture both familiar and strange in its variably dramatic contrasts.                  "
Poetry,2010,100,                      That untapped potential and creativity lurking even within ordinary people is the overriding theme of Lee's achingly poignant film.                  
Josee the Tiger and the Fish,2020,100,"                      Gentle and empathetic, this Japanese animation celebrates friendship and the joys of encouraging others.                  "
Evil Eye,2020,44,"                      I found my mind wandering as I waited for the inevitable twist. You know, the ones that have come with every “Welcome to Blumhouse” film so far.                  "
When We Leave,2010,74,                      The movie is suffocated by its own grim determinism.                  
You Are Here,2010,83,"                      A thought-provoking experience, and hopefully just the beginning of Daniel Cockburn's career in filmmaking.                  "
Diana,2021,80,                      The Princess gives pretty much equal time to media and sensation alike. This makes a much-told story fresher than it might otherwise be. It also makes the story even more unsettling.                   
Evil Dead,2013,63,"                      As gorefests go, you could do a lot worse.                  "
Scarborough,2021,100,"                      It’s a love letter but bittersweet, directed by Shasha Nakhai and Rich Williamson. It sure pulses with life.                  "
Ghostbusters,2016,73,"                      Instead of doing something memorable with the great chemistry we see from the cast, “Ghostbusters” settles for being another in a long line of mediocre 80’s movie remakes.                  "
N Secure,2010,20,                      This movie is horrendous. Not sure how or why this got made.                  
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,2014,21,                      I can’t think of a recent blockbuster that’s been raked across the coals as much as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.                  
Raajneeti,2010,22,                      Rajneeti is a layered film with a lot of nuances. Every scene becomes a revelation to the overall direction of the story.                  
Behind the Candelabra,2013,94,"                      Soderbergh seems most intent on normalizing homosexuality itself, and he does that by zooming straight out to the furthest reaches of stereotype and straining for the banal amongst the golden slippers and snarling houseboys                  "
How to Be Single,2016,46,                      Feels more like a failed television pilot than a feature film.                  
Casting By,2012,94,"                      While the movie is not especially thoughtful (to put it mildly), it's worth seeing for all its revelatory TV clips and for celebrating one of the great female innovators in post-World War II movie history.                  "
Lost Boys,2020,80,"                      Tense, shocking, tragic and rewarding; the documentary feels destined to acquire more and more praise and attention as it is seen by more audiences.                  "
Shit Year,2010,33,"                      Movies that require work and participation from the viewer are more than welcomed, but not something that is as frustrating and impenetrable as this.                  "
Hello Ladies The Movie,2014,71,"                      As a romantic comedy that stands on its own, Hello Ladies: The Movie hits every objective.                  "
Last Call,2020,82,"                      An entertaining ride for horror fans which benefits from great production design, The Call uses its clichés for a purpose and has fun along the way.                  "
The FP,2011,50,"                      One of the loudest, most ridiculous, entertaining movies I've seen in a long, long time.                  "
The Family,2016,100,"                      The Family is a provocative documentary about an aspect of Australian history few under a certain age recall, and Jones's film grants a voice to those who had so long been denied one.                  "
Blitz,2011,48,"                      Smart, sharp, shocking, and at times bloody (and bloodily) hilarious, Blitz's witty script and pacy action elevates its simple premise into a brilliantly gritty tale of moral ambiguity.                  "
Another World,2021,100,"                      Adopting a realism redolent of Ken Loach, French director Stephane Brizé keeps aiming at social injustices, questioning the ferocity and blind cruelty of modern corporations.                  "
The Hustle,2019,13,"                      Whatever you want to call Chris Addison’s The Hustle — a remake, a reimagining, a lazy retread — either way, his film is unoriginal, uninspired, and unworthy of your time.                  "
The Watch,2012,16,                      It might’ve been funny if it wasn’t trying so hard to be funny.                  
David,2013,60,"                      David coasts on a few startlingly sharp scenes and zippy musical interludes, but doesn't add up to the sum of its zanier parts.                  "
Twas the Night,2021,43,"                      Twas the Night is a Christmas-themed dark comedy that's as unappealing as stale egg nog: It's nauseatingly bad, and it just plain stinks. The movie's weak plot is made even worse by the entire cast having amateur-level, horrendous acting.                  "
365 Days This Day,2022,0,"                      Nobody’s watching 365 Days for any reason than to see Anna-Maria Sieklucka’s Polish ingenue, Laura, get railed by Michele Morrone’s alpha-roid mafioso, Massimo.                  "
Inland,2022,80,"                      Inland takes the talents of an Oscar winning actor and wastes them in a ponderous tale of introspection. Only sound design saves this pretentious arthouse hybrid from ignominy, while pacing proves to be a real issue throughout.                   "
Iron Man 3,2013,79,"                      Better than its immediate predecessor but not quite topping the original, this third entry in the franchise proves to be one of the best from Marvel yet.                  "
Every Day,2010,34,                      ...an excellent cast can't save a plot drowning in obviousness.                  
The Irishman,2019,95,"                      In a lot of ways, this film is the antithesis to “Goodfellas”, a eulogy to the gangster genre the same way “Unforgiven” was a eulogy to the western genre.                  "
Yogi Bear,2010,13,"                      Lazily plotted and tiredly predictable, the film reminds me of one of that other Yogi's most famous phrases: ""It's deja vu all over again.""                  "
Dancing Queens,2021,33,"                      The movie means well, but it also doesn't do anything to really push the genre to new and/or interesting places, nor does it really say anything about drag culture, drag representation, or gender generally, and for some, it could feel a bit touristy.                  "
Standing Ovation,2010,6,"                      A slight, poorly thought-out take on Disney's plethora of music franchises                  "
Locked Down,2021,42,"                      Going from mean-spirited relationship comedy to a heist film is an awkward jump even if everything works, but despite having a backdrop that everyone can relate to Locked Down ends up feeling removed from its audience.                   "
Seeking a Friend for the End of the World,2012,55,"                      In its depiction of The End, it’s quite brave and oddly beautiful. The film takes hold of you all of a sudden and won’t let go. Before you know it, your eyes begin to tear up, and a lump develops in your throat.                  "
The Execution,2021,91,                      The non-linear narrative can be difficult to follow at times but it allows director Lado Kvataniya to build up a picture of the investigation with the benefit of hindsight.                  
One Way,2022,56,"                      Steeped in the rain-soaked, neon-bathed lore of ‘70’s American crime-noir thrillers; it is not too hard to envision a version of One Way with Walter Hill calling the shots and a cast boasting the likes of Bruce Dern and Warren Oates.                  "
The Line,2022,63,                      We sit through the entire hour and 41 minutes thinking there will be some kind of revelation as to what happened to cause such an outburst. But no. It never comes. A strange decision…strategy…way to tell a story.                   
Unidentified,2020,80,"                      The result, an attempted mixture of adrenaline, madness and despair, never managed to keep me on the edge of my seat.                  "
The Offering,2022,100,                      The Offering’s thoughtful interpretations of Jewish folklore and demonology make the storytelling effectively horrifying as well as meaningful and make this an accomplished debut feature film.                  
The Trip,2021,92,                      “The Trip” isn’t for the faint of heart. Some scenes are extremely intense and the further it goes the gorier the movie gets. Yet it’s all fused with this wicked sense of humor that often pops up in the most unexpected moments.                  
Kill Your Darlings,2013,76,"                      Though it's not perfect, Kill Your Darlings is hard to fault with such a brilliant cast bringing the Beat generation to life with such precision.                  "
No Hard Feelings,2020,100,"                      ""No Hard Feelings"" drives toward queer futurity in unexpected ways and is an absolutely remarkable debut for the young director.                  "
Animal Kingdom,2010,95,"                      Animal kingdom is contemporary realism, but Mechod entwines insinuations of a Greek tragedy or Shakespearian drama. [Full review in Spanish]                   "
The Wall,2008,77,                      Pölsler has created a captivating and emotionally compelling parable which harks back to an era when popular sci-fi functioned as a thoughtful and vital study of contemporary issues.                  
Vikram Vedha,2022,79,"                      Succeeded as an original, but falls flat in its Hindi version...                  "
The Oranges,2011,31,"                      Sometimes, just sometimes, white picket fences and an SUV aren't all that bad.                  "
Hold Me Tight,2021,84,"                      When leaving the cinema, after seeing this beauty, we are going to need a giant hug. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
Applause,2009,89,                      Applause offers no softening euphemisms -- but plenty of sharp humor -- in its depiction of a gifted artist struggling to reform herself as she rages against the vulnerabilities of middle age.                  
Borat Subsequent Moviefilm,2020,85,                      This time around everything feels far more manufactured...                  
Olga,2021,91,"                      Despite the fact that the tape was filmed before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, now it becomes more relevant. The naturalistic way events are recorded is compelling, and so is the acting.  [Full review in Spanish]                  "
The Housemaid,2010,70,                      Im saves the grotesquery of the wealthy to the last minute. But the build up (to the not so subtle climax and ending that can be read as slapdash) is so engaging and understated that it only amplifies the brilliance of Im's precision filmmaking.                  
Incarnation,2022,20,"                      The very basic story was presumably written with the limitations of the COVID age in mind, but that doesn’t excuse its lethargy, predictability and dearth of scares.                  "
Splinters,2011,82,                      A hybrid work that will appeal to both surf-movie fanatics and armchair sociologists.                  
The Year Dolly Parton Was My Mom,2011,40,                      A wonderfully low-key but engaging movie about identity.                  
Plan B,2021,96,"                      Plan B offers the counterpoint that this genre of film can live on, but that it maybe just needs some new perspectives through which these stories are being told.                   "
Bleed with Me,2020,83,"                      Psychological horrors abound in Moses’s film. She combines a dark chamber drama about personal relationships, whether intimate or otherwise, with claustrophobic terror.                   "
Chatroom,2010,9,                      Veers into thriller territory with predictable results. It's strange that a movie so lacking in substance arrives with such pedigree.                  
The Interrupters,2011,99,                      It's a heart wrenching tale of a few brave souls who take it upon themselves to step deep into this world ... and do what they can to prevent further tragedy from happening.                  
Nothing Personal,2009,82,"                      A strangely beguiling, if slight, romance; beautifully filmed and acted by its two leads.                  "
Death at a Funeral,2010,43,                      The only realistic thing here is the funeral because this cadaver arrived at the multiplex already in an advanced state of rigor mortis on the edge of putrefaction.  [Full review in Spanish]                   
In the Heights,2021,94,                      In the Heights is a feel-good movie of the summer.                  
Oldboy,2013,39,"                      Lee’s not-inconsiderable talent makes a fine attempt to interpret the story with two or three unique touches, but he doesn’t make it vital or offer a fresh take.                  "
Grace,2017,88,"                      From a purely visual standpoint, the second act of the film is great.                  "
The Lovers,2015,8,"                      If you're aching to see a tragic tearjerker romance, then the only tears you will shed will be of frustration.                  "
Lone Wolf,2020,40,"                      It's a film of style over substance, which offers an eventual payoff (however predictable) for those willing to see it through, but drags its feet longer than necessary in the process.                  "
August Osage County,2013,67,"                      I was put off by these characters, their endless dysfunction, and their profane spite. This was a tiresome watch and tough movie to endure. It’s a shame because with this much talent I was expecting more.                  "
Beast,2022,68,"                      …Beast is passable Saturday night fare, but despite a lot of hard work on the technical side, this lion doesn’t make much of a roar…                  "
Faith of Our Fathers,2015,9,                      There are times that Faith of Our Fathers feels like Dukes of Hazzard meets 1950s war serial meets every bad buddy movie ever made.                  
Father,2020,100,                      Nikola’s unwavering determination in the face of callous dismissal should inspire all of us to redouble our efforts to advance righteous causes.                  
My Son,2021,38,"                      Pity McAvoy, who was left to improvise.                   "
The Mill and the Cross,2011,79,"                      It's a compelling museum piece, an engaging piece of art history brought to vivid life by a man with a keen understanding of its roots and origins.                  "
Lady Boss The Jackie Collins Story,2021,100,                      Lady Boss is a fascinating look at a truly unique character.                  
Father of the Bride,2022,79,"                      The clashes between the clans raises the occasional smile, but screenwriter Billy Lopez's humour is mostly heavy handed.                  "
Lola,2020,80,"                      [Filmmaker Laurent] Micheli, in addition to good intentions, knows enough about cinema to understand that characters are everything. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
Apex,2021,11,

The Kid,2010,50,"                      Although there are a few nice-ish cameos - Ioan Gruffudd pops up, as do James Fox and Jodie Whittaker - it's not enough to save this film from itself or give it any kind of emotional authenticity.                  "

The Runway,2010,80,"                      It's the feel-good stuff that directors dream of, and Ian Power's directorial debut has a broad, gentle appeal that will please all.                  "
Endangered Species,2021,19,"                      ""Endangered Species"" fails to provide a reason to remain invested in clumsy screenwriting and performances, diluting the shock value Bassett is hoping to deliver.                  "
Shimmer Lake,2017,60,"                      Shimmer Lake requires attention be paid, or prepare for a head-scratching conclusion as the pieces finally align for the story's end game. Or maybe that's the beginning game?                  "
Suicide Squad,2016,26,"                      Bad pacing, horribly chopped-up story structure, and dull forgettable action.                  "
Total Recall,2012,31,                      [The film] spends so much of its time trying to duplicate aspects of the original that the filmmakers were distracted from their most clever ideas.

The Way,2021,100,"                      AlthoughThe Wayis slow-moving and too long, with some blunt acting, it offers some well-executed cinematography, eliciting a feeling of the severity of spiritual transformation within a prison and inmate mindset.                  "

Downsizing,2017,47,                      Payne stretches the film for well over two hours and never quite realizes the possibilities of his central conceit.                  
When the Bough Breaks,2016,12,                      It was incredibly boring.                  
Bless Me Ultima,2012,68,"                      It wants to be something grand, but its ambition far exceeds its reach.                  "
In the Heart of the Sea,2015,42,"                      As the tale unfolds, told within another tale, it becomes clear that this is also about narration and narrators, unreliable and otherwise.                   "
Oscar,2011,12,"                      Despite all the running around, the movie still feels slow, dragging sluggishly toward the end of its long 109 minutes.                  "
Jackpot,2009,59,"                      As Nordic imports go, it's hardly as offensive as lutefisk.                  "
And Soon the Darkness,2010,17,"                      While not terribly original, ""And Soon the Darkness"" is an entertaining film that, within genre confines, delivers exactly what it promises-tension, suspense, and a story that catches and holds your attention throughout.                  "
Resistance,2011,65,                      This life-affirming adventure into the abyss and back of one truly fascinating character has a social message that ought to be heard by all.                  
Black Site,2022,29,"                      While the film succeeds in its action elements, it fails when it comes to portraying characters of color. Every character of color is treated as fodder and killed off...                  "
Last Man Standing,2021,50,"                      There is some considered debate about what really happened, but nothing more than conjecture that most viewers will have guessed anyway. Come for the archive footage, but dont expect any answers.                   "
Beyond the Wall,2022,40,"                      Bafflingly thin on characterisation, the lack of sympathy for these awfully one-dimensional characters is augmented by Mohammadzadeh’s irritatingly one-noted self-important performance and Habibi’s lack of range.                    "
The Hunger Games,2012,84,                      It’s a dystopian science fiction film that’s based on a preposterous premise yet it manages to be strikingly entertaining.                  
Mad Max Fury Road,2015,97,                      This is pure action cinema – a beautiful mixture of old-school style and modern movie technology.                  
Prisoners,2013,81,"                      “Prisoners” offers some slick foreboding, crafty twists, and a satisfying ending.                   "
Showing Up,2022,95,"                      Showing Up is a comedy of frustration that’s funnier for being composed of such intellectually conceived parts, a new kind of movie for Reichardt and the cut-above conclusion this Cannes needed.                  "
Helena from the Wedding,2010,50,                      ...distractingly low-rent...

Agent Vinod,2012,36,"                      Daftly plotted, featuring a garbage Pritam soundtrack, and tonally all over the place, Agent Vinod is a particularly terrible relic of an odd couple of years for the Hindi film industry in which several critical darling filmmakers tried scaling up.                  "
When I Walk,2013,88,"                      So much of this documentary is like a smattering of poor selfies and vlog entries--context-less, background-less and persistently, frustratingly short on details--that it remains less memorable than your average Hollywood disability biopic.                  "
Outcast,2010,64, 
It,2017,86,                      The film is just as much an evocation of troubled adolescence as it is a horror romp featuring a malevolent clown.                  
Winnebago Man,2009,90,"                      One of the funniest, most perceptive, humane and culturally relevant documentaries in ages.                  "
Taken 2,2012,22,                      Besson and Megaton have delivered a sequel that fails in every way to live up to its predecessor.                  
Villain,2012,67,"                      ...bridge between traditional British policiers and the more modern take on criminality featured in, say, The Long Good Friday....                  "
Straight Outta Compton,2015,89,"                      The story is epic enough that audiences will experience the significant musical and social influence N.W.A. had on the larger community of hip-hop, and how that influence continues to shape contemporary artists.                  "
The Shadow,2009,71,"                      A PTSD allegory concerned with exactly how torturous war becomes emotionally on those affected by it, as well as those who've participated in it.                  "
The Leech,2022,89,"                      Christmas lights are strung and axes are swung, and it all culminates in a festive descent into madness and mayhem that feels destined to become a perennial indie-horror favorite.                  "
Unknown,2011,55,"                      This is a by-the-numbers thriller, in which nothing is what it seems, but nothing is what it seems in pretty much the way you’d expect, if that makes sense.                   "
Book of Love,2022,49,                      Any blossoming romance is unearned.                  
Switch,2011,33,"                      It's awful, but at least it is one of my favourite kinds of awful film: so awful it's a triumph.                  "
Black Venus,2010,100,"                      Tunisian born...director Abdellatif Kechiche (""The Secret of the Grain"") has been making films about the immigrant experience in his adopted France, all involving theatricality of one form or another.                  "
The Wasteland,2022,58,"                      While too many creepers come across as derivative and old hat, there are still filmmakers who are constantly finding new ways to use horror. “The Wasteland” certainly falls among the latter.                  "
Blue Moon,2013,20, 
Hell Hath No Fury,2021,93,                      ... A decent although flawed character-based action flick.

Paradise Love,2012,78,"                      What Seidl achieves here is truly commendable. But dang, it's one of the saddest movies I've ever seen.                  "
Wolves,2014,20,"                      There aren't a lot of surprises, but the all-important transformation scenes are furry fun and any horror film with Stephen McHattie is worth a look.                  "
Limbo,2021,93,                      One of the greatest strengths of the film is the way that it beautifully balances tone. Sharrock skillfully manages to deftly move between comedy and tragedy... the result is something simultaneously heartbreaking yet uplifting.                  
Nostalgia,2022,91,"                       The film ends on a slightly too simplistic, but it cannot take away from its overall highly sensitive and formally rigorous exploration of nostalgia and of the other, different relationships people can afford to have with their past.                  "
Courage,2021,100,"                      Little by little, theatre and reality become intertwined, each adding depth to the other. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
Control,2022,71,"                      Director James Mark keeps the imagery sleek and the atmosphere intriguing but, even when another person appears, it's difficult to care about characters and a situation that are so undefined.                  "
The System,2022,40,"                      Ranging from preachy to lazy to flat-out ridiculous, this prison-fight drama benefits from committed work by Gibson and Howard, but they can't overcome saggy storytelling and uninspired filmmaking.                  "
We,2021,80,"                      It is good to pay tribute to “small lives” ... at a time when the human rubbish that lives at the top of society, the billionaires and their celebrity hangers-on, take up so much of the media’s attention.                  "
True Grit,2010,95,"                      With impeccable crafts on display, highlighted mainly by the gorgeous cinematography from Roger Deakins, the world feels detailed in its period representation and enthralling in the adventures it presents.                  "
Election,2013,92,                      A movie of unexpected savagery and caustic wit.                  
Our Father,2022,78,"                      Our Father is a compelling story, one that explores the fragile intersection of social, legal and cultural ailments.                  "
Naked Ambition An R Rated Look at an X Rated Industry,2009,38,                      It's less a documentary than a promotional video for [director Michael Grecco's] book...                  
Blacklight,2022,10,"                      I love me a Liam Neeson film. I love his late career resurgence. I love his ""special set of skills"". But there are no catchphrases for Neeson this time around...                   "
The Wheel,2021,91,"                      The Wheel thinly stretches the 'will they or won't they break up' dilemma for the movie's central married couple, until the movie's very last scene, which is the best part of the film. This relationship drama is mostly well-acted but very repetitive.                  "
Violet Tendencies,2010,63,"                      While the tone may feel inconsistent, the performances remain remarkably steady.                  "

Carnaval,2021,17,"                      This frothy film about the #lifelessons an Instagram influencer learns during Carnival in Brazil is as superficial as it sounds, but its postcard-perfect setting and gorgeous cast are easy to watch.                  "
Dream Home,2010,76,"                      Don't let cheesy puns or rhyming couplets put you off what is otherwise an altogether more sophisticated approach to a macabre topic, fusing political commentary with grisly scenes of graphic, uninhibited violence.                  "
Star Trek Into Darkness,2013,84,"                      Though not what every Trekkie will want but undeniably thrilling on its own terms, Star Trek Into Darkness is a solid follow-up to 2009’s breakthrough and will leave audiences wanting more.                  "
Ride Along,2014,18,"                      Ride Along plays out like the buddy action comedy that Ice Cube and Chris Tucker never made outside of the Friday franchise. Instead of Tucker, though, Ice Cube is paired with the equally excitable loudmouth Kevin Hart.                  "
On Broadway,2021,76,"                      On Broadway doesnt exactly break new ground, but it does offer a fascinating blow-by-blow account of Broadways past 50 years.                   "
Retreat,2011,62,"                      ""Retreat"" would actually work better as a play since it has a limited setting, four characters at most and director Carl Tibbetts would be less tempted to amp up a heavy-handed score.                  "

Filth,2013,66,                      Jon S. Baird's manic adaptation of Irvine Welsh's novel maintains a constant high for much of its 97 head-spinning minutes before it sets up into a confrontation between a broken man and his personal demons.                  
Mooz Lum,2010,80,"                      I cried because I saw pieces of my soul in a movie. It spoke to me; deeply. It's a movie that, on some level, I was thirsty for. And I hadn't realized how thirsty I was.                  "
Along for the Ride,2022,57,                      The thing I liked the most is Auden's misguided certainty about herself.                  
On Tour,2010,85,                      While On Tour settles a little too easily in conclusion for the troupe-as-one-big-family clich... the film's engaging confidence and inclusive good nature prove [Mathieu Amalric]'s worth watching both as an actor and a director.                  
Savior,2014,56, 
Ted Bundy American Boogeyman,2021,0,"                      Ted Bundy: American Boogeyman aims for chilling and lands on boring, and fails mightily to justify its existence.                  "
Donna,2022,71,                      This moving documentary about 70-year-old trans woman Donna Personna is a missed opportunity.                  
Gravity,2013,96,                      ...the work of an efficient master dominating his artistic form.                  
Copacabana,2010,77,                      The film finds occasional big laughs out of Huppert's observations of those around her and eventually warms the audience to this character.                  
Crimes of the Future,2022,80,"                      Cronenberg's style [is] a finely honed, mysterious ability to make medium-shot coverage of characters talking on chiaroscuro-shaded stage builds weirdly entrancing.                  "
The Cellar,2022,31,"                      Bares all the gothic offerings austerely: tension between science and the occult; darkness as a representation of Evil; space as an architectural likeness of those who inhabit it. Well-known iconography, but in the end, it works. [Full review in Spanish]                   "
My Afternoons with Margueritte,2010,85,                      The scenes between Germain and Margueritte are so strong that other sequences almost feel like filler.                  
Khatta Meetha,2010,17,"                      A couple of things stop this from being a good Priyan movie. It is criminally long, burdened with flat comedy tracks as faulty as Sachin Tichkule's roads.                  "
We Have a Pope,2011,66,"                      Moretti proposes a personal, disquieting and provocative look at themes such as faith and personal beliefs. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
Release,2010,14, 
Rio I Love You,2014,8,                      A failure on all counts.                  
Tomorrow When the War Began,2010,64,"                      As a film made for it's teenage fans, it mostly succeeds.                  "
Padre Pio,2022,44,"                      But even with its flaws, Padre Pio can be recognized as an admirable and deeply personal effort — for both its director and its star — that still packs the occasional cinematic punch.                  "
Fortress,2021,20,"                      Fortress moves at a slick pace, and its action scenes are most thrilling.                  "
The Kings of Mykonos,2010,30,                      Old wogs enter a new world in this spirited ethnic romp.                  
The Conjuring,2013,86,                      What’s special about The Conjuring is how well director James Wan controls this environment. He uses the setting like a filmic funhouse ride spring-loaded with precisely timed jolts and screams.                  
Kidnap,2017,35,"                      This premise is pure exploitation - or rather, it aspires to pure exploitation. Pure exploitation would be welcome in place of Kidnap, which is too vastly stupid to even exploit properly.                  "
Alone Together,2022,31,                      Heartfelt but limp COVID-19 lock-down film set in the pandemic.                  
Polaris,2022,100,"                      If the film is successful, it is in showing these relationships just beyond the figures of mother and daughter, focusing on a horizontal bond – that of sisters who share the same pain   [Full review in Spanish]                   "
2050,2020,20,"                      A series of disconnected scenes, rather than a narrative with a sense of momentum.                  "
The Devil You Know,2022,33,                      The Devil You Know is diverse but has a lackluster story...                  
Home Team,2022,19,                      Home Team is The Waterboy without the charm or Henry Winkler.                  
Railway Children,2022,57,"                      Even though the sappy drama Railway Children is told from the perspectives of children during World War II, it's still no excuse for how the movie mishandles issues such as racism and military desertion. The movie's last 15 minutes are atrociously mushy.                  "
Pimp,2010,0,"                      Tight close-ups and direct-to- camera confessionals are the order of the day in a film so peppered with sleazy sex, casual violence and endless swearing that it comes perilously close to caricature. Nobody's finest hour.                  "
Better This World,2011,100,                      The filmmakers do an excellent job of presenting all sides of the issue.                  
Meskada,2010,33,                      Small in scope but smart in the way it deals with how cosy communities react when something rotten surfaces in their world.                  
The Accursed,2022,20,"                      It kicks off with a terrific opening scene, but that promise is soon dashed as this horror movie rolls out dull characters and predictable plot turns. Ultimately it winds up feeling overly familiar and half-hearted.                   "
Surviving Progress,2011,71,                      Muddled with no motivation...                  
Dream House,2011,7,                      This is a movie featuring loads of talent and at its core a familiar but fairly interesting story. But it’s also a movie plagued with amateurish writing and an off-the-rails ending that undermines everything the movie tries to do.                  
Brother and Sister,2022,56,"                      As ungalvanizing as it is, I've been watching Desplechin's work in more or less real time for 20 years, and I can't deny the comfort of another round.                  "
The Conductor,2021,100,                      A portrait of a truly inspiring woman who has changed the classical music scene and empowered other women musicians.                  
Accepted,2021,95,                      We definitely get a sense of how tenuous college dreams are for teens whose parents never went through the process themselves.                  
Big Sur,2013,44,                      Sparked an awareness of drama and documentary's interconnectedness and the impossibility of truly separating their elements in a digital age.                  
The Grandmaster,2013,78,"                      A case of style over substance. But, oh my, what style.                  "
All Is Bright,2013,49,"                      The Two Pauls -- Giamatti and Rudd -- shine in another downbeat ode to humanity from director Phil Morrison (""Junebug"").                  "
The Price of Freedom,2021,100,                      Ehrlich interweaves images of the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection and commentary from Mary Anne Franks...                  
The Call,2009,44,                      There is just enough tension and just enough suspense to keep you invested. Unfortunately the eye-rolling ending almost undoes everything the film does right.                  
Big Mommas Like Father Like Son,2011,5,                      Big Momma's 3 isn't offensive. It isn't an unkind portrayal of obesity and its themes are light and carefree. But it's still dreadfully unfunny.                  
Sick,2022,94,"                      Each shot, camera movement and cut–as well as blocking and prop placement–are perfectly calibrated to make Sick as infectiously watchable as it is shocking.                  "
Uncharted,2022,41,"                      While Uncharted rarely veers away from the charted territory, the film has enough fun with itself for an enjoyable ride.                  "
I Am Number Four,2011,33,"                      Stylistically it's a mess too. The film contains little, at source, that is its own...                  "
The Great Hip Hop Hoax,2013,89,"                      A story so good, it can only be true.                  "
Heartbreaker,2010,68,"                      If it is guilty of any crime, it's the same one as Juliette's poor fiancé: inciting boredom.                  "
The Wedding Party,2010,43,"                      Clumsily cobbled, tonally confused romantic comedy...a terrific premise with strong leads is sadly derailed by too many side stories.                  "
Paradise City,2022,9,                      Paradise City has a capable cast working with a script that was concocted overnight. At best it feels like a free paid trip to Hawaii for everyone involved.                  
Cloudburst,2011,100,"                      Olympia Dukakis is utterly brilliant here, a magic mixture of brash and rude and tenderness and determination.                  "
Square Grouper,2011,75,                      The director's touch is evident in the way he chose just the right backgrounds and costumes for each character; the DEA agents wear blue suits in a bland outdoor setting while Platshorn wears a Hawaiian shirt ...                  
Lyle Lyle Crocodile,2022,73,"                      The simple plotting and broad characterisation is bolstered by some pretty effective special effects work, and performer interaction with the towering, computer-generated crocodile is impressively seamless throughout.                  "
Burning,2021,94,"                      Burning is a fine introduction to the topic of the government's failure to act on climate change, with enough conviction and personality to feel both engaging and captivating.                  "
Happily Ever After,2010,57, 
White Elephant,2022,14,                      There’s nothing really original about White Elephant. But that doesn’t stop it from being both thoroughly entertaining and genuinely captivating as the crime action thriller is elevated by a fine leading performance from Michael Rooker.                  
Stranger Things,2010,83,"                      One of the assets of ""Stranger Things"" is its air of mystery, and the actors give the indelible impression that they have much locked away inside.                  "
Get a Job,2016,9,                      ...exceedingly (and often egregiously) broad...                  
Baywatch,2017,17,"                      A movie based on a show about brain-baked lifeguards isn't going to stir memories of, say, A Man for All Seasons or The King's Speech or even Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, but within its own parameters, Baywatch knows the territory.                  "
Monsters,2010,73,                      There are few films I've enjoyed as much as Monsters this year. There are even fewer films I wish I hadn't watched so I could watch them fresh from the beginning again.                  
Poker Face,2022,9,                      A film that is constantly trying to bluff its way out of the story it sets up to be and like the gambler who keeps chasing their losses it is way too far in the hole to develop any interest late when it finally settles into a plot it wants to follow.                  
Falling for Christmas,2022,58,"                      Hokey as heck, sure. The holiday bedazzling is fun, the preposterous story is easy comfort, and it's great to see LIndsay Lohan doing well                  "
The Violent Kind,2010,18,                      It's one of those movies that belongs in an incinerator rather than a cinema.                  
Rainbow,2022,20,"                      Whether playful musical or modern realism, the tone of Rainbow is decidedly both. But there are plenty of moments that seem to contradict these two modern vibes so colorfully and carefully plastered all over the film's presentation.                   "
Paint It Black,2016,88,"                      If that sounds a bit florid, then you've got the idea. Paint It Black is purple and overcooked, swelling to burst with rococo emotion. It doesn't always hold together but it's too outstanding to be ignored.                  "
First Love,2022,40,"                      The untapped potential here is considerable, though the cinematography and performances ensure that the film remains watchable.                  "
Mammuth,2010,63,"                      Cynical and sentimental by turns, Mammuth takes a ride on the wild side, but well within speed limits.                  "
Lucky,2011,15,"                      Drama cannot live on wobbly metaphors alone, and the untenable roles are played without charisma.                  "
The Counsel,2010,34,"                      Just as he's done in many of his novels, McCarthy's first screenplay follows his stylized, almost mythically cynicism with unwavering detachment and insight.                  "
Sunshine,2009,76,"                      Sunshine is a film that is hit or miss and while your mileage may vary, one cannot deny the cinematic ambition of it all.                  "

Midnight,2021,100,"                      Midnight enthralls in its thills, excels in its execution, and allows a talented cast to bring this repeatedly anxiety-inducing stunner to life. A real hidden gem, seek this one out!                  "
The Aviators,2008,90,"                      [T]hough the meandering has a certain (non-whimsical) charm, and [Anne-Laure] Meury [as Lucie] is innocently captivating, the film takes too long to reveal its coherence.                  "
Evolution,2021,100,                      Staging decisions... reverberate through time and footage. [Full review in Spanish]                  
Aquaman,2018,65,"                      “Aquaman” is an oddly satisfying blast. It’s nothing groundbreaking or highly original, but it is a movie that embraces its weirdness in a way I really appreciated.                  "
A Piece of Sky,2022,90,"                      The film could not be more Swiss if it were made out of chocolate, yet it feels real, organic, a natural expression of the world in which it is set.                  "
Bridesmaids,2011,89,                      Unforgivable two hours and a half.  [Full review in Spanish]                   
The David Dance,2014,33,"                      The film, with these two elements working with the script, feels cozy and personal. The David Dance is a well-crafted family drama with characters the viewers can care about and want to follow through their rough patches.                  "
The Art of Racing in the Rain,2019,45,                      Here is a film made for that lazy Sunday afternoon that makes you appreciate what you have or long for what you don’t.                  
Tempest,2012,55,"                      Tempest boasts a little Shakespeare, a little Fellini, a lof of Cassavetes, and almost nothing of the Mazursky touch we've come to expect from the director of Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice and An Unmarried Woman.                  "
The High Cost of Living,2010,53,                      So artistically well-intentioned and earnest in its ambitions that you can almost forgive the banality of its every scene.                  
Illegal,2010,70,"                      This is a film with a message, but it doesn't preach. The primary focus of the story is not on the immigration issue, but on Tania and her love for her son.                  "
Hit the Road,2021,95,"                      Hit The Road took me to a country I have never visited, introduced me to people I have never met and made me fall in love. It is a wonderful, pretty much perfect wee gem. Do go and see it.                  "
The Other,2020,100,"                      In addition to L'Autre being an eloquently told story, it offers something to the viewer something that very few films on the subject have failed to provide in the past, the ability to sit in the sheer awfulness of death on their own terms.                  "
Ablaze,2021,100,"                      This heart-soaring doco from his grandson, working alongside historian and co-director Alec Morgan, writes Bill’s mighty contribution to Country back into the records.                   "
Vortex,2021,93,"                      The opening song talks about the ephemerality of life and from there, a story that is as suffocating as it is Lynchian is born. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
Barbaric Genius,2011,83,                      The films overall structure and a number of holes in the story tremendously weaken Duane's documentary.                  
On the Line,2022,16,                      Gibson tries to capture that same manic energy here as the dark and edgy man-pushed-to-the-edge [Lethal Weapon's Martin Riggs] and does a good job of it - perhaps that was the attraction for him to this role.                  
The Lorax,2012,54,                      It's hard to imagine children not enjoying the film.                  
Jim,2010,38,"                      Morris-Burke does deserve applause for what he has accomplished technically on a shoestring budget. His location scout is a hero. But the over-complicated, under-emotional Jim's reach ultimately exceeds its grasp.                  "
Oblivion,2013,54,"                      There’s no denying that Oblivion is derivative.... But director Joseph Kosinski, adapting his own graphic novel, sure knows how to make it look beautiful and evocative.                  "
Spork,2010,55,"                      A quirky, imaginative and outrageously funny little movie that will speak to more of us than any of us would like to admit.                  "
Dig,2022,17,                      The threadbare story is threadbare.                  
The Trouble with Bliss,2011,33,"                      Ultimately, ""The Trouble With Bliss"" is a more positive way to use one's time than Morris is spending his.                  "
Bus Stop,2012,80,                      A hilarious farce.                  
8 The Mormon Proposition,2010,65,                      I don't want you to think this movie was boring; it was actually fascinating and actually required watching for every gay person everywhere!                  
Sisu,2022,100,"                      ""Sisu"" knows exactly what it is and what it wants to do — and it does it well.                  "
Asking for It,2021,23,"                      Asking for It is all posturing, setting up a neo-Old West showdown for our modern sexual political times, but it’s half-assed and a quarter-brained, a checklist of feminist-empowerment cliches and easy targets.                   "
The Jesus Music,2021,63,                      If you love Christian music you will love The Jesus Music. If you don't you might still love it. It's one of the best documentaries of the year!                  
The Enforcer,2022,40,"                      The Enforcer certainly is dour. But for what it’s worth, seeing the baddies get their comeuppance is undeniably cathartic.                    "
The Greatest Showman,2017,56,"                      Quite incongruously, The Greatest Showman suggests that Barnum is a heroic figure, a woke entertainer and family man, who also capitalized on animal suffering and the veritable prostitution of human oddity.                  "
Red Riding Hood,2011,10,"                      Red Riding Hood is an entertaining take on Little Red Riding Hood that takes the fairytale, ... , and puts it all in beautiful settings, shoots it all with great cinematography, and has a few really good performances at the center of it all.                  "
Tamara Drewe,2010,64,                      Loses all its supposed cunning in this conflicting adaptation.  [Full review in Spanish]                  
The Raven,2012,22,"                      It’s all very watchable in a low-expectations way, though anyone hoping for a tale worthy of Poe himself should look elsewhere.                  "
Craigslist Joe,2012,33,"                      Craigslist Joe is not just an interesting ""experiment"" and well told documentary, but a telling look at human nature and the fundamental goodness within us all.                  "
F,2010,79,"                      Tonally similar to the French horror picture Them, this is nasty, gritty and efficient when it comes to delivering the thrills and chills.                  "
Blasted,2022,40,                      Nothing makes enough logical sense to allow us to enjoy the dramatic tension that comes from hoping a plan will work.                  
V H S 94,2021,91,"                      On their own merits, each of the four shorts have things worth applauding. But unfortunately after each, we're forced to come back to the framing story. And aside from some gnarly imagery, nothing in it comes close to the quality of the shorts.                  "
I Love America,2022,46,"                      Taking an earthy, realistic approach to both the imagery and the voiceover narration, writer-director Lisa Azuelos gives this autobiographical comedy-drama a strongly personal kick.                  "
Adventures in Zambezia,2012,25,"                      The plot is a hokey, muddled mess about a young falcon who wants to go to a fabled city of Zambezia, where all birds live in harmony and under the protection of the Blue Falcons...                  "
Dead for a Dollar,2022,53,                      Dead for a Dollar‘s weak dialogue wastes its immense star potential.                  
Madalena,2021,83,"                      Different song cue or no, Marcheti’s restaging isn’t in conversation with, or in any way enriching, either its source or itself...                  "
Booksmart,2019,96,"                      A breakout moment for stars Beanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever, as well as for first-time director Olivia Wilde, Booksmart is utterly hilarious.                  "
Central Intelligence,2016,71,"                      The artist formerly known as The Rock has long since proven that he has more natural acting chops than any other former muscleman-turned-thespian (sorry, Arnie), and he's absolutely riotous here.                  "
The Lego Movie,2014,96,"                      Great voice acting, sharp writing, and a wonderful story all the way down to its core.                  "
Meet Cute,2022,58,"                      Lehmann’s film, though visually arresting, is a bit of a mess at times. However, if this romcom teaches us anything, it’s that it’s okay for things to be a mess sometimes                  "
Gentle,2022,78,"                      An immersive, often melancholic, study of the paradoxes of a world where the perfect external look is frequently achieved by ruining the body on the inside through drugs, and where staying in control is paramount.                  "
Granito,2011,40,"                      The movie is erratically paced, often static and dry, and occasionally dull. But the subject matter keeps you intrigued - barely.                  "
I Saw the Light,2015,19,"                      With some excellent cinematography from Dante Spinotti and a crowd-pleasing soundtrack, I Saw the Light should have an appeal that goes beyond the devoted Williams and Hiddleston fan bases.                  "
Fin,2021,82,"                      The information in Fin might not be entirely new or eye-opening, but Roth's unflinching gaze and breadth of knowledge make the movie feel comprehensive.                  "
Shattered,2022,19,"                      Shattered ably ticks genre boxes, but fails to drill into the characters in a way that counts.                  "
Forgetting the Girl,2012,75,                      Just exactly how much of yourself you're willing to invest in Forgetting the Girl may depend upon how quickly you manage to pick up the story's twists.                  
Powder,2011,0, 
Nature Calls,2012,5,                      Nature Calls eventually becomes something of an ordeal to sit through...                  
Section 8,2022,31,"                      All would be forgiven if the action was top notch, but instead it’s merely serviceable. ... A case of a young director calling their shot, or pure hubris? Possibly a bit of both.                  "
Future My Love,2012,63,                      There are sadly only occasional flashes of inspiration to be found within this arch demi-installation piece.                  
The Tree,2010,72,                      You can probably guess what happens. But the standard-issue life-after-death flick is worth watching just for Gainsbourg.                  
Swallowed,2022,87,"                      The tension of Swallowed is immediate and ever-present. The ""body horror isn't as Cronenbergian as your imagination is maybe hoping for but it's a desperate tale of survival designed to make your skin crawl.                   "
The Paperboy,2012,45,"                      Fans of the genre and fans of the talented cast will be amply rewarded, but this is definitely not a film for all audiences.                    "
The Whisperer in Darkness,2011,86,"                      The filmmakers cared about every moody shadow, every slightly stodgy performance, and (of course) the dark, disturbing imagination of H.P. Lovecraft.                  "
Horrible Bosses,2011,69,                      The energy and hilarity steadily run out as the film barrels towards the expected conclusion.                  
Private Romeo,2011,55,"                      While certain aspects, like the interspersed Youtube videos, feel a little clunky, overall the end product is well worthwhile. Add to that, a wonderfully talented cast makes this movie worth a watch.                  "
Anita,2021,67,"                      Anita aptly captures Muis brilliant life of forty years: of excitement, loss, and change, but most importantly of hope.                  "
Bad Boys for Life,2020,76,"                      “Bad Boys for Life” teases itself as the final chapter, the end of the trilogy, “one last time“. Don’t believe it, especially in today’s franchised obsessed movie culture.                   "
Halloween,2018,79,"                      When you have framed yourself as a direct sequel to an all-time horror classic and you’ve wiped out a lot of the series history, it’s easy for us to expect a little more than a standard slasher film.                  "
Fantastic Four,2015,9,                      Trust me when I say this – reading about the movie is a lot more fun than watching it.                  
Monogamy,2010,48,"                      Director Dana Adam Shapiro has turned out a fascinating exploration of what can happen when we make assumptions about the person we love and the relationships we're in, and how easily we can destroy ourselves in the process.                  "
Oliver Sherman,2010,50,"                      The north-of-the-border setting promises fresh perspectives but local novelty can't disguise universal clichs, despite Dillahunt's memorably haunted star turn.                  "
Windfall,2022,58,"                      Terrible, talky three-hander...A good idea squandered, waste of a top cast. Chalk it up as a dud.                  "
Jane,2022,63,"                      Jane is an interesting watch, and certainly a good showcase for showing both Petsch and Bailey as more multidimensional, skilled performers.                  "
The Parking Lot Movie,2010,78,"                      The Parking Lot Movie is a slice of Zen heaven, a tiny perfect movie shot in a single location.                  "
Road to Nowhere,2010,73,                      These jigsaw pieces don't fit together.                  
Husk,2011,80,"                      Not terrible, but the 27-minute version was better.                  "
Stay Awake,2022,91,"                      Sisley tells the story on a personal tone, showing how the drama goes hand to hand with humor, and how in  the most difficult moments, humans can get a connection beyond any limit. [Full review in Spanish]                   "
Madame X,2021,67,"                      Madonna continues to revel in pushing boundaries and remaining original, and she promises to live to 200 in her wide-ranging new concert documentary.                  "
Urville,2009,71,                      Fuel for the imagination.                  
Haywire,2011,80,"                      It’s a fast moving and compact story, and Soderbergh’s direction keeps everything running smooth.                  "
Bottom of the 9th,2019,69,"                      It shows an affinity for baseball and a love for New York's cultural melting pot, but this heartfelt working-class redemption drama mostly swings and misses.                  "
Cargo,2011,67,                      Suspenseful and captivating albeit not as unflinchingly horrifying as it could have been.                  
The Greening of Whitney Brown,2011,13, 
Blue Moon,2021,67,"                      Chitu gives a quietly dignified performance, gradually letting us see Irina’s strength through her resilience.                  "
Le Havre,2011,99,"                      An intimate, romantic, tender and humanist story... [Full review in Spanish]                  "
Crush,2022,76,"                      Crush doesn't do anything particularly revelatory to subvert its rom com tropes, but the easy going chemistry of the cast and queer WOC representation makes this an easy watch. Also: King Pun's art is delightful.                  "
The Three Musketeers,2011,26,                      The only thing that really saves the day is Christoph Waltz.                  
Ass Backwards,2013,27,"                      The movie's one joke is that they don't quite realize how pathetic they are. This kind of joke could work if the characters were charming and had the ability to win over other characters, but these women remain stupid and annoying throughout.                  "
The Woman with the 5 Elephants,2009,91,                      Transcends the documentary form and attains its own sort of artfulness - a quiet and lyrical study of a truly remarkable human being.                  
Just Like Us,2010,70,                      It offers an honest look at a region about which most Americans know little.                  
Losing Control,2011,7,                      Losing Control nicely mixes comedic absurdity with weightier career vs. commitment themes.                  
Sundown,2021,77,"                      Franco has never had any fondness for privilege, or much for human nature; with his latest penetrating film, he's as unforgiving as always, but also as committed to unpacking what it means to define your own path.                  "
The Visit,2015,68,"                      While Shyamalan doesn’t reinvent the wheel with “The Visit”, he does show the creative flourishes that made him a respected name and overnight success in the horror-thriller genre.                  "
The Falls,2021,89,"                      Anchored by phenomenal acting, iThe Falls/i is a nuanced pandemic-set film, with tonal shifts that offer surprises at every turn.                  "

Thin Ice,2011,69,"                      Thin Ice is a good movie, and depending on your tastes, this may even be a great movie. It's well written, well acted, well shot.                  "
Sherlock Holmes A Game of Shadows,2011,59,"                      Unfortunately the uniqueness, humor, and charm of the first film are all but missing in the sequel.                  "
Private Property,2022,13,"                      An archetypal rehash of a familiar story from yesteryear, L.A Seduction fails to fully reignite audience interest in the near forgotten sub-genre of film.                   "
Puzzle,2010,77,"                      It's both funny and touching that one of María's favorite puzzles is an enigmatic portrait of Nefertiti. With her own enigmatic allure, María is the queen of puzzlers.                  "
The Host,2013,10,                      Fails to adequately explore either its characters or the specifics of its concept-driven world.                  
A Star Is Born,2018,90,"                      While the story of “A Star is Born” may be familiar, there are enough good choices from Bradley Cooper to make his version of this ‘oft told tale’ feel fresh.                  "
Raw Faith,2010,100,"                      Part personal documentary and part doc-as-tribute, Raw Faith needed a true star to work at all. She's found in Marilyn Sewell, a sixty-something Unitarian minister.                  "
The Wrath of God,2022,29,"                      The misleadingly titled The Wrath of God is both compelling and disappointing. Told as a horror mystery, the long-awaited big reveal at the end reveals only what we've known all along, which has nothing to do with either God or the occult.                   "
Area 51,2015,13,"                      You know the drill: A bunch of dudes, determined to go somewhere they shouldn't, decide to record their experience and things go bad. Very bad.                  "

Hot Summer Days,2010,50,"                      Unlike the similarly multi-strand Valentine's Day, Hot Summer Days has heart, however overstated most of its action.                  "
Hold Your Fire,2021,95,"                      Sad, very dark... tremendously revealing. [Full review in Spanish]                   "

Gabi on the Roof in July,2010,73,                      This is a movie that manages the neat trick of being impressive and infuriating at the same time.                  
Anonymous,2011,46,                      This is a clever concoction for those who enjoy an enduring mystery.                  
Sacrifice,2010,70,                      Both a thrilling swordplay epic as well as an intimate chamber drama about clashing filial loyalties.                  
Tortoise in Love,2012,45,"                      Tortoise in Love is a pungent red herring, a fatally unfunny comedy that's neither warm nor enchanting.                  "
Fire Island,2022,94,"                      Fire Island still triumphs as a playful and sometimes heartwarming movie, even if it doesn’t quite climb out of the sandpit it dug for itself...                  "
Vanishing of the Bees,2009,58,"                      So, while the cold hard facts may be important enough to make this a film worth watching, the message is in danger of getting lost to all but the most hardy of audiences.                  "
Kaboom,2010,60,                      This Gregg Araki joint is an absurd blend of sex and mayhem.                  
Contraband,2012,51,"                      Everything about Contraband is fleeting. It's an exercise in formula that only manages to excite you a little bit more than it will surprise you, which is not at all.                  "
The Vatican Tapes,2015,20,"                      The Vatican Tapes isn't exactly ground-breaking... but it's a solid, well-written, well-performed, and surprisingly original addition to the over-populated parnanomal/demonic possession/exorcism-themed pantheon.                  "
Vacation,2015,27,"                      A kind of a cross between We're the Millers and Identity Theft without any real driving purpose, Vacation is an odious mix of tasteless humour and ""teachable moments"".                  "
Apart,2011,11,                      Tries too hard and ends up substituting pretension for punch.                  
Magic Camp,2012,100,"                      It's a documentary that champions the idea that kids need outlets like magic to truly be their original selves, a praiseworthy message if there ever was one.                  "
Mili,2022,80,"                      Mili takes its time to get to the suspenseful part of the movie, but it's worth the wait. The acting performances are very good, while the movie's editing and musical score skillfully increase the tension.                   "
Gun Hill Road,2011,65,                      Films like Gun Hill Road with Latino leads are a rarity in independent gay cinema. The film further sets itself apart in that one of its leads is transgendered on screen as well as in real-life.                  
Maneater,2022,17,"                      Despite a few shocking kills, there’s little in this fish film to make anyone scared to go back into the water.                  "
Shady Grove,2022,40,                      Shady Grove suffers from dialogue and pacing issues. Everyone else recites lines that sound like lines. It’s directed like a stage play with rigid blocking considering the material everyone is given to work with feels like recited dialogue.                  
On the Edge,2011,67,"                      The pieces are all exceptionally well-cast -- credit producer Jana Sue Memel and casting directors Mary Margiotta and Karen Margiotta -- and none outstays its welcome, which is the great advantage of short films.                  "

Byzantium,2012,66,"                      From the stunning compositions to Eleanor’s thoughtful narration to the poetic drama of Jordan’s treatment, the theme of storytelling itself unfolds and transforms what may be considered familiar vampire material into operatic fantasy.                  "
The Lie,2011,74,"                      Leonard plays Lonnie with unflattering commitment: you've gotta credit a fellow who plays feckless, selfish and dim so fully.                  "
Out of the Blue,2022,15,"                      Neil LaBute’s commitment to the femme fatale homage works for awhile and Diane Kruger is more than game, but instead of following suit in subverting our expectations the film settles into becoming a DTV Wild Things sequel with a tenth of the twists.                  "
The Big Picture,2010,86,                      A stirring and thought-provoking picture driven by a brilliant performance from Romain Duris. It asks more questions than it answers and allows the audience to wrestle with the rights and wrongs. I like that.

No Way Out,2022,20,                      The two leads Bichicchi and Mitchell show promise. They hold your interest in a confusing but somewhat interesting story.                  
The Estate,2021,27,"                      As with all black comedy, audience reactions will vary by taste. We found this one most peculiar.                  "
Elysium,2013,64,"                      The result disappoints not only because it fails to meet our admittedly unrealistic hopes that it might live up to Blompkamp’s first, but because, ironically enough, the outcome isn’t as polished as his sophomore effort.                  "
When Harry Tries to Marry,2011,13,                      ...an egregiously familiar romantic comedy that hews far too closely to the well-worn formula that one has come to associate with films of this ilk.                  
Hope Springs,2012,75,                      Tommy Lee Jones may very well steal the film with one of his most emotionally satisfying and complex performances.

Faces in the Crowd,2011,0,"                      Super hilarious. One of the funnier movies I've seen in a while, and takes itself so seriously that you can't help but burst out laughing in moments of supposedly heightened tension.                  "
Sanctuary,2022,95,                      Viewers will feel just as mentally twisted as Abbott's character as Qualley's winds through her desires and intentions - and that's the thrill of Sanctuary. Each moment breaking away the barriers of what's real and what's orchestrated.                  
What Happened to Monday,2017,59,"                      What Happened To Monday? has plenty to enjoy, starting with its lead.                  "

Bonded by Blood,2010,9,"                      Worth watching, but the whole just isn't nearly as effective as some of the parts.                  "
A Single Shot,2013,48,"                      Despite Rockwell’s fine acting, there’s little suspense or emotion to bond us to A Single Shot or its cast of backwater characters.                  "

Desperados,2020,15,"                      Desperados wants to pretend that it's feminist and edgy, when it's really not ... At its core, the film's message about how women should act and how women should be rewarded when looking for love is as old-fashioned as a Doris Day movie.                  "

Mortal Engines,2018,26,                      It's actually a little bit more soulful than it lets on.                  
Honey,2010,85,"                      A fascinating mix of the studious and the artful, a strange amalgam of left and right brained filmmaking.                  "
Tees Maar Khan,2010,10,"                      The screenwriters manage to redeem Khan; but it's not quite enough to save the movie, which, given the velocity of the frantic action, should have played brisk and buoyant.                  "
Late Bloomers,2011,44,"                      William Hurt and Isabella Rossellini, with help from a smartly chosen supporting cast, prevent the film from being paper-thin as well. However, this drama will not stay long in the minds of most audiences.                  "
Elena Undone,2010,50,"                      Elena Undone is a captivating tale of desire, secrets, lies, and familial strife.                  "
Inuk,2010,80,"                      The result is a deceptively stylish, powerful film about a corner of the world we rarely see.                  "
Good Neighbours,2010,67,                      This film has one of the best murder scenes in recent film memory. It's brutal and hilarious at the same time - and a must-see for cat lovers.                  
The Dilemma,2011,24,"                      Masks much of its laugh-out-loud funniness with dark humor, subtle jests, and highly serious drama.                  "
Barbarian,2022,92,                      A hilarious and enervating offer that replicates and rebuilds extremely familiar resources with enough intelligence to shape one of the great horror films of 2022.                  
Chasing Ice,2012,96,"                      True, there's no blood this time around, no gruesome images of dolphins dying, but it could be argued that the supernaturally beautiful images that Balog (and, by extension, Orlowski) captures are even more despairing and alarming...                  "
Edge,2010,57,"                      It's clear that Edge is trying to make a statement, yet it's so intent on doing it in an overtly-artistic manor that it loses itself and the viewer.                  "
I Used to Be Famous,2022,89,"                      It does allow viewers to see Ed Skrein cast against type as a musical loser dreaming to make a comeback. Honestly, that was enough for me.                   "
Somewhere Between,2011,88,                      An enlightening documentary about four girls adopted in China by American parents who as teenagers are struggling with their identity and whether to learn more about their birth families.                  
The Good Doctor,2011,66,                      An intermittently fascinating character study about a plain man who does evil things for selfish reasons.                  
Passing,2021,90,"                      There’s no easy answer, and that’s where Passing excels— the gray areas.                  "
Unforgivable,2011,77,
Jews and Baseball An American Love Story,2010,67,                      It's a must for baseball fans-Jewish or otherwise.                  
The Roundup,2022,96,"                      'The Roundup' cuts straight to the chase: all it wants is to use a real-life story to develop a predictable and archetypical plot, and deliver brutal and well-choreographed action scenes. And it does as promised. Full review in Spanish.                  "
Bodyguard,2010,29,"                      The film, a remake of a South Indian hit, may end up as another blockbuster, like most Salman films have been doing in the recent past. Yet, sadly, this one's mostly bluster.                  "
Summertime,2011,91,                      An intelligent and well-acted romantic drama.                  
If I Were You,2012,13,"                      It's been a minute since we've seen [Marcia Gay Harden] in a really juicy lead role, and she sinks her teeth into this one. How unfortunate then that nothing else about the film even comes close to matching her considerable talents.                  "
Maleficent,2014,54,"                      It is a righteous revenge film, but with a feminist twist and a redemptive journey.                  "
I Anna,2012,61,"                      Neither thrilling, entertaining nor particularly thought-provoking.                  "
Ticked Off Trannies with Knives,2010,71,                      These ticked off trannies are a must see.                  
Warm Bodies,2013,81,                      There’s nothing sexy about flesh-eating zombies whose very being is tantamount to an unstoppable disease. They lurch and eat brains; they probably don’t smell the best; their bodies are walking rot.                  
Brother,2010,54,"                      Hermano is part sports film, part neorealist drama and a fully successful debut feature from Venezuelan director Marcel Rasqun.                  "
Sleeping Beauty,2011,48,"                      ... Too calculated, precious, and artificial to be captivating. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
How I Ended This Summer,2010,79,                      Bleak and unfulfilling psychological thriller set at a Russian meteorological camp on a desolate island in the Arctic Circle.                  
The Late Bloomer,2016,20,                      Silly but has its moments.                  
Confessions,2010,81,"                      ""Confessions"" was a bona fide cultural phenomenon that sent shockwaves through Japan's collective conscience before the tragic earthquakes and tsunami drove people further into soul-searching.                  "
Insidious,2010,66,"                      With Insidious, Wan and Whannell prove that they are not just one-trick ponies and deliver one of the scariest and best horror films of the new century.                  "
Take This Waltz,2011,79,                      Sarah Polley holds it together with a sure sense of the film's tone and outlook and is helped along by an endearing performance from Michelle Williams.                  
Lockout,2012,38,"                      “Lockout” takes a lot of its inspiration from those 80’s action flicks, and it unashamedly tries to recreate the tone and feel of those films.                  "
Swerve,2011,37,"                      If you can grin and bear the fact something always comes up to replace the previous problem just solved, there is entertainment to be had.                  "
LOL,2012,14,"                      A glossy but shallow Hollywood adaptation of the hit French film Lol: Laughing Out Loud. The original director, Liza Azuelos, is at the helm too, but the sass and spark of the French movie seems to have been lost in translation.                  "
The Substitute,2022,100,"                      Like his protagonist, Lerman looks at this world with a genuine desire of belonging and invites the audience along. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
Trigger,2010,88,"                      Witty, moving and immensely satisfying, Trigger is a real gem, and far better than a movie so quickly slapped together has any right to be. It says a lot about what can be accomplished when filmmaking is fired with urgent devotion to a common purpose.                  "
Norm of the North,2016,6,"                      Has little to recommend it. Padded with dance numbers - two in the first fifteen minutes alone - and montages, the best that can be said is that bad movies like this are important to remind us that the Pixar movies aren't flukes.                  "
Disenchanted,2022,40,                      It's the hilarious song battle between Adams and Maya Rudolph's local busybody that is this film's pièce de résistance.                  
Fast Five,2011,78,                      Affords itself the luxury of passing two and a half hours within being boring. [Full review in Spanish]                  
The Big Short,2015,89,                      Trying to keep up with all of the fast market talk and financial blather wore me down. And there’s so much emphasis on it that the movie comes off as overstuffed and missing the human element which would have given it a more powerful punch.                  
Once Upon a Time in Brooklyn,2013,0,"                      Solid performances can't save the film from its banal, convoluted screenplay that leaves no room for interpretation or subtlety.                  "
The Black Tulip,2010,25,"                      Getting a film like The Black Tulip filmed, produced and out into the public is an impressive feat -- it's just a shame the effort didn't yield a better film.                  "
Z for Zachariah,2015,79,"                      Zobel engages his audience not through the normal and expected genre machinations, but by peeling back revealing layers of humanity.                   "
Contagion,2011,85,"                      It develops the threat, raises the stakes, and lets a remarkable cast tell the story.                  "
Going Down in LA LA Land,2011,67,"                      Going Down in La-La Land was a surprisingly entertaining film, a pretty solid indie.                  "
Safe House,2012,53,"                       I had a great time with “Safe House”, and I don’t penalize it for aiming at a specific mark and hitting it.                  "
The Family Jams,2009,40,"                      As frustratingly inconsistent as The Family Jams can be, fans of freak folk will likely find just enough rare footage to make it worth their while, but everyone else would be wise to sit this one out.                  "
Abduction,2011,5,                      Are pouting and flexing emotions?                  
Rejoice and Shout,2010,76,                      Rejoice & Shout is the most definitive and uplifting film ever made about gospel music. And that's the gospel truth.                  
The Grey,2011,79,"                      All this talk could have been dull, but Carnahan keeps it interesting via extensive use of intimate, close-up, almost claustrophobic shots.                  "
Only God Forgives,2013,41,"                      Aside from Scott Thomas, whose performance is magnificently over-the-top, the actors and storyline have almost no humanity to them, serving only the film’s vague metaphor about punishment.                  "
Amour,2012,93,                      This is a story of true love – a love between a husband and wife that only grew stronger through the many years they experienced together. It’s a love that’s taken for granted today and often times treated so flippantly.                  
Princess,2014,82,"                      A mix of sweet and sour, Princess's exploration into teenage sexuality is an interesting, albeit confused one - although that is surely the point.                  "
Caught Inside,2010,86,                      Caught Inside is a small film that absolutely hinges on the riveting performance of Ben Oxenbould as Bull. This guy is an intimidating nightmare and the remote location of the island paradise increases his threat.                  
Prom,2011,35,"                      This movie feels like an uninspired cover song, and I can't imagine wanting to expose a kid to this when the originals are more entertaining, more challenging, and still out there.                  "
My Uncle Rafael,2012,20,"                      For anyone who has the bad luck to see this vanity production, it will be remembered as one of the worst films of the year--if not the decade.                  "
American Reunion,2012,45,"                      It can strive to stay current, but it really belongs as an appreciated time capsule to a different generation.                  "
Frank,2014,92,"                      Abrahamson perfectly balances Frank’s gradual downshifting of tones from offbeat comedy to emotionally bare drama in the final act, as the best indie comedies often do.                  "
The Happy Poet,2010,73,"                      A cutting edge social satire about vegetarian pushcart power. And how work, or the lack of it, informs our lives. Along with the struggle to survive in hard times, while serving up poetic revenge subversion of the Hollywood happy ending with relish.                  "
The Monk,2011,65,"                      This overblown, yet strangely immersive Faustian tale takes the narrative foundations of a Shakespearean tragedy and forces them through a Gothic filter with erratic results.                  "
The Woman in the Fifth,2011,59,                      A stylish but oblique picture that offers little in the way of neat resolution.                   
The Last Ride,2011,47,                      Henry Thomas gives his best performance in quite some time.                  
Knuckle,2011,93,"                      Knuckle allows you to spend an hour and a half inside a ceaselessly captivating world you likely didn't even know existed. That alone is worth something. It's unfortunate that Palmer wasn't interested in doing more with what he had, though.                  "
Sushi Girl,2012,50,"                      All of the characters are unsympathetic, and the actors all seem to get such joy out of exploring their own sadistic sides.                  "
My Way,2011,21,"                      Kang Je-kyu's big-budgeted WWII melodrama offers up a kitschy, overtly violent tale about two rival marathon runners caught in a continent-hopping battle of blood, guts and bad dialogue.                  "
The Vow,2012,31,                      A paint-by-numbers romance yet it is a paint-by-numbers romance that will work for those who surrender to it.                  
Win Win,2011,94,                      It contains enough heart and humor to please virtually anyone.                  
The Other Dream Team,2012,88,                      Contains a wealth of high quality interviews.                  
Limbo,2021,93,
Farmageddon,2011,57,                      It takes a clever writer to convey this level of charming empathy without any dialogue...                  
Better Living Through Chemistry,2014,22,"                      Cynical dark comedy ""Better Living Through Chemistry"" stands out against other foul-mouthed, indie-ish capers for one reason: Sam Rockwell.                  "
The Edge of Dreaming,2009,100,"                      It's a wonderful little film that doesn't try to do too much, but what it does accomplish it does so with great clarity and intimacy.                  "
The Woodmans,2010,95,"                      Francesa Woodman died believing she was unique, and she was.                  "
Absentia,2011,87,                      ...it's pretty clear that Flanagan makes movies I want to watch...                  
Thunder Soul,2010,100,                      The kind of movie that sinks under your skin.                  
The Soul of Flies,2011,71,"                      Burely's The Soul of Flies shows a great deal of promise for a first-time director, but as a feature in its own right, its enjoyable elements are jarringly disparate and fail to make for a successful whole.                  "
Crossroads,2012,15,                      A stinker from top to bottom...                  
The Snow Queen,2010,0,"                      Overall I can't really recommend The Snow Queen to adults because I didn't really like it very much. That being said, I do not have kids but if I did they could do a lot worse then watch.                  "
Kon Tiki,2012,81,"                      Somewhat akin to the similarly sea-bound Life of Pi, Kon-Tiki's visual splendor stems from the film's painterly art direction and lush cinematography.                  "
Little Red Wagon,2012,45,                      Fits perfectly within the filmography of Indiana born David Anspaugh.                  
Little Deaths,2011,100,                      a tripartite compendium whose very title (a metonymic phrase for orgasm and post-coital tristesse) promises a transgressive admixture of sex and death that the three films certainly go on to deliver.                  
Headhunters,2011,93,"                      The point of Headhunters isn't where you land, but the wild ride taken to get there, and that part of the film definitely delivers.                  "
Savages,2012,50,"                      While the juicy performances and exciting meat of Savages are vicious fun, it’s a film whose feeble conceit undoes the pleasures of its base appeal.                  "
Margin Call,2011,87,"                      Even though Chandor isn't trying to turn his characters into something abominable, the truth is that each of them is, on a bigger or lesser scale, an evil to society. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
The Foreigner,2017,66,"                      It is a superb film for Jackie Chan, who really needs to flex his dramatic muscles more often.                  "
Cellmates,2011,47,                      A lifer with little chance for appeal                  
Alvin and the Chipmunks Chipwrecked,2011,12,                      Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked. This is one munkventure you don't want to miss!                  
Boy,2011,88,"                      As with all great comedy, there's some sadness and grit at its core that grounds the laughs in a relatable drama.                  "
Love Child,2020,100,                      Director Eva Mulvad follows the family everywhere and over the course of years. Her camera captures all from video chats with friends at home to Mani having a meltdown.                  
One Day,2010,42, 
Trick,2010,79,                      It’s an accurate snapshot of our big-city gay lives.                  
The Waiting Room,2012,100,                      The Waiting Room is an important look into what is fast becoming one of our most important institutions. But that's all it is -- a glimpse.                  
Murder Mystery,2019,44,                      It’s not fresh enough to be called original and not smart enough to be called a parody.                  
The Last Witch Hunter,2015,18,"                      Operates in a series of tropes and clichés, neither improving nor innovating upon them.                   "
The We and the I,2012,70,"                      Gondry's visual inventiveness is still here, but it's probably not a coincidence that his most stripped-down film is also his strongest in years.                  "
Racing Extinction,2015,82,                      This documentary strikes an effective balance between alarming statistics and practical solutions.                  
Jackie,2016,88,                      Surprisingly this isn’t a puff piece aimed at reinforcing Jackie’s venerated cultural image. It doesn’t shy away from her weaknesses or blemishes. At the same time it doesn’t shortchange her strength and fortitude.                   
Break My Fall,2011,25,"                      It doesn't amount to much, though the post-punk soundtrack adds bite.                  "
A Wrinkle in Time,2018,42,"                      This colossal springboard from the family film of teen issues to the epic intergalactic adventure ""A Wrinkle in Time"" desires to be is more than a little haphazard.                  "
Dabangg,2010,60,                      I recommend that you see the film for the sheer pleasure of watching Salman Khan in top form.                  
The Addams Family,2019,45,                      Every attempt to inject a little Addams in our lives should be rewarded.                  
Free Birds,2013,20,"                      Feels average, like a flightless bird trying to soar with the Pixars of the genre.                  "
Cesar Chavez,2014,38,"                      Even in a film failing to reach the lofty achievements of its namesake, there is still much to learn and enjoy here.                  "
Natural Selection,2011,74,"                      Despite its shortcomings, Natural Selection is an enjoyable film.                  "
Bill Cunningham New York,2010,99,                      Cunningham seems to take more joy in his work on the streets as he rides about town on his Schwinn.                  
Approved for Adoption,2012,100,"                      The anecdotes Jung shares ache with honesty, effectively relating how he eventually reconciled his lack of a past with the promising future his new family offered him.                  "
30 Minutes or Less,2011,45,"                      Though it won't win any awards for its plot, the film does excel in the department it clearly directs all its efforts toward: dialogue.                  "
Life Goes On,2010,40,                      Likable if more than a trifle laboured...                  
The Exiles,2022,84,                      The Exiles doesn't do a good job of addressing the aftermath of the massacre... or justifying making the documentary in the first place. Full Review in Spanish                  
Final Destination 5,2011,62,                      Bloody delicious catnip                  
The Arbor,2010,96,"                      Though The Arbor is hard to watch, it's even harder to define, but it's clear that this is Andrea, this is England, and this is extraordinary.                  "
Oz the Great and Powerful,2013,56,"                      The result isn’t bad and incites the intermittent chuckle, but it ultimately fails to fill The Wizard of Oz’s shoes.                  "
I Will Follow,2010,82,"                      Before 13TH and Selma, Ava DuVernay was making her big-screen directorial debut in I Will Follow - and it doesn't disappoint.                  "
Bluff,2022,83,                      By its end ‘Bluff’ feels more like a melo drama than a crime thriller with the way it shifts from being about an undercover detective on a mission to a man emotionally disturbed by the loss of a friend.                   
Young Adult,2011,80,                      Charlize Theron is the self-absorbed central character in a script of such meticulous cruelty that it’s like watching someone pulling the legs off a spider.                   
Hector and the Search for Happiness,2014,38,                      Want to be happy? Don't waste your time or money on this movie.                  
Cameraman The Life and Work of Jack Cardiff,2010,97,"                      For fans of Cardiff, for fans of the Archers, and for fans of all great cinema, Cameraman is a must-see.                  "
Mausam,2011,20,                      The calibre of the direction is inevitably going to be compared with Kapur's acting prowess. The two do not match-the latter being streets ahead.                  
Ghosted,2011,36,                      An overwrought and predestined misfire.                  
Careful What You Wish For,2015,17,"                      As a purported erotic thriller, it's neither particularly erotic nor remotely thrilling.                  "
Kidnapped,2010,44,"                      The ethical / aesthetic balance simply does not exist in 'Kidnapped', a film for stomachs that are easy to impress -better not to mention the violent prologue- and undemanding. [Full Review in Spanish]                  "
Miss Lovely,2012,56,"                      An indictment of exploitation while at the same time reveling in it, ... a paean to analog movie-making in a time when the world is going digital.                  "
Courageous,2011,36,                      The best film yet from Sherwood Pictures.                  
The Estate,2022,29,"                      An amazing cast trapped in a coarse, crude script.                  "
Klondike,2022,96,"                      Seen through a woman's eyes, it's a gripping mix of personal drama and punchy themes.                  "
Cold Fish,2010,74,                      What could have been one of the best and most disturbing thrillers of the year gets somewhat spoiled by a potentially vile subtext and a very mean-spirited finale where the film totally lost me.                  
Romeo and Juliet in Yiddish,2010,75,                      A charming and entertaining movie that instills a little fantasy into the mix.                  
Dragonslayer,2011,90,                      Dragonslayer authentically portrays Sandoval in all his adrift glory while seeming to blur the lines of what a doc can be with effortless craft.                  
Underdogs,2013,67,"                      Soccer-themed story has strong message, some iffy humor.                  "
Bloodshot,2020,31,                      Bloodshot is as common an action-adventure film as O+.                  
Intruders,2011,31,"                      Aside from Owen and Van Houten, who both have natural presence, there’s nothing here except dissatisfaction and ridicule waiting in the shadows.                  "
Johnny English Reborn,2011,38,                      An unnecessary sequel to a mostly forgettable film.                  
Grassroots,2012,50,                      Grassroots is an incredibly unimaginative and painfully dull film -- perhaps one of most erroneous entries of the year.                  
Trust,2021,71,                      ...a relatively well-paced drama that benefits from its unabashedly salacious storyline...                  
Bubble,2022,50,"                      It’s just a shame, because had the characters been interesting and had the story put even a modicum as much effort into the script as it did the key set pieces...                  "
Project X,2012,28,                      This movie trying to be a knockoff of Superbad is exactly the point.                  
Will,2011,0,"                      It's a silly symphony of embarrassment, a sentimental journey along a road paved not with yellow bricks but red cards.                  "
Aftershock,2022,100,"                      ""Aftershock"" is a confrontation, a reminder that “Black Lives Matter” isn’t just a rallying cry against overt, visible brutality like what’s performed by the police.                  "
Descendant,2022,100,                      A thematically rich documentary about the last ship to bring enslaved people to the United States.                  
In Time,2011,37,"                      The acting is solid, if not spectacular... with a little more care and attention, In Time could have been one for the ages.                  "
Ted,2012,69,                      Ted becomes a character that’s more than just a plot device or source of vulgar humor; he’s one of those oddly real characters brought to life by subtle and effective special FX.                  
Last Flight Home,2022,94,"                      Brave, informative, but exclusive.                  "
Calendar Girls,2022,100,                      What I loved most about the doc is how it turns on its head our idea of what it is to be over 60. These women show that you can still be active. Life does not end at 60.                  
The Mission,2022,65,"                      The Mission is a case study in the limitations of prioritizing, broadly speaking, “developing empathy for others” as (one of) nonfiction filmmaking’s primary goal(s).                   "
The Territory,2022,97,"                      The Territory is not devoid of hope, and what proves most compelling is the desire of the Uru-eu-wau-wau to tell their own story.                  "
Jersey,2021,50,                      Jersey is a sweet little drama that hits a home run on the strength of its heart and hero.                  
The Patience Stone,2012,84,"                      The process is all too artificial, ultimately doing a disservice to those whose lives it attempts to reflect.                  "
The Armstrong Lie,2013,82,                      A portrait of man who lied with a straight face and yet doesn't seem to quite understand or accept the repercussions of his actions. Fascinating stuff on a complex subject.                  
Hobo with a Shotgun,2011,66,"                      There are two kinds of people in the world, people who will watch a movie called Hobo With A Shotgun, and people who will avoid it at all costs. I fall in the former category, and if you do too, I have to believe that you will fall in love.                  "
Armadillo,2010,89,"                      The creators of the Danish documentary, Armadillo, about the Afghan war, lacked the moral or political fortitude required to make a film critical of imperialism.                  "
96 Minutes,2011,50,"                      While 96 Minutes has its flaws, there are absolutely people out there who will enjoy it. At the very least, with its strong director and cast, I imagine this will be a notable footnote in some prominent careers.                  "
Terraferma,2011,67,"                      There's a poetic rhythm to the arresting visual compositions that couch on magical realism, and its bittersweet melancholic tone, no matter how bluntly delivered, is still an effectively realized portrait of tenuous humanity.                  "
My Piece of the Pie,2011,50,"                      Whether or not it fully works is questionable. In my opinion, it does not really, growing a bit exaggerated even for the world Klapisch has laid out. Yet the final act does make good thematically and, depending on your politics, quite satisfyingly so.                  "
Citadel,2012,56,"                      grim and bleak, piled high with moodiness, tension, and ominous atmosphere. It really is truly unsettling, and doesn't dissipate easily.                  "
The Grudge,2020,20,                      It ends up being an aggressively middle of the road movie and the kind we’ve come to expect in early January.                  
Dark Nature,2022,86,                      It’s an agreeable enough thriller that has unwisely cribbed from a beloved modern genre staple and simply can’t measure up to its predecessor.                  
The Bride,2022,26,"                      Nothing to re-invent the wheel certainly, and not always subtle but still effectively entertaining and with some nice little references for fans of the lingering source material.                  "
Four,2011,67,"                      The film manages to create a brooding atmosphere that slowly tightens its grip, sloughing off familiar tropes concerning race and sexuality and hitting enough subtle notes to become more intense the more quiet it becomes.                  "
Inside Job,2010,98,"                      Inside Job by American documentarian Charles Ferguson (No End In Sight) is a valuable, detailed account of the global financial meltdown in September 2008.                  "
The Dictator,2012,56,"                      Laughs are few and far between, which comes as a surprise given how Borat and Brüno managed to be two of the most riotously funny movies you’ll ever see.                  "
Loveless,2011,80,                      Loveless proceeds like a messy younger sibling of Noah Baumbach's Greenberg.                  
I Wish I Knew,2010,100,"                      A city symphony in a minor key, reminiscent of Pennebaker and Ruttman, that searches for the soul of a people and finds a microcosm of a century of upheaval and uncertainty.                  "
Life Above All,2010,82,"                      Manyaka is enormously affecting as Chanda, stubborn, passionate, strong and fragile in equal measure. She is supported by a superb cast.                  "
Stay the Night,2022,86,"                      What follows is a simple, sweet story about two people who may (or may not) be falling in love with each other over the course of a long evening.                  "
Bedevilled,2010,88,                      Too arty for K-horror buffs and too grisly and nonsensical for world-cinema aficionados.                  
How to Train Your Dragon 2,2014,92,"                      Being at once a self-contained story and a continuation of a franchise that betters and grows more intricate than what came before, the film meets all the requirements of a great sequel.                  "
Jasmine,2015,60,"                      Jasmine tells a good story of grief and obsession, taking us down a very dark path.                  "
The Double,2011,21,"                      Character motivations, sequences of events, and that thing called plausibility are all a bit offensively slapdash.                  "
Wrath of the Titans,2012,26,"                      It has some nice eye candy and a few pretty cool moments, but it lacks the kick and the grit of the first film.                  "
Wasted on the Young,2010,60,"                      Wasted on the Young's pulsating soundtrack, immediate direction by first time filmmaker Lucas ... and Leanne Cole's hectic editing all lend the film a vibrancy that is sorely lacking in a lot of cinema these days.                  "
Amnesia,2015,77,                      Amnesia is a very passive piece. The film legitimately expresses deep revulsion for fascism.                  
Face to Face,2011,91,"                      Face to Face will never be mistaken for the most exciting film of the year, but it's a bold one nonetheless that rewards viewers with spiky wordplay and tart performances.                  "
The Dark Tower,2017,15,"                      Elba is good with what little he’s given, and you could say he is a reminder of the potential this film had.                  "
Darling,2010,67,                      Miss Christie's performance is remarkably vibrant and outgoing.                  
The Gray Man,2022,46,"                      Despite its fast-paced rhythm and the caliber of the talent in front and behind the camera, it ends up being an unimaginative and formulaic spy flick. [Full Review in Spanish]                  "
The Impossible,2012,81,"                      A punishing experience, with hardly a moment after the first twenty minutes where a lump isn’t in your throat or tears welling up in your eyes.                  "
The Other City,2010,100,                      A fascinating and damning glimpse inside a parallel universe that exists right in the heart of our nation's capital.                  
Wreckers,2011,92,                      It's clear to see that Hood's skill lies very much as a director.                  
SGT Will Gardner,2019,22,"                      It really means well and it's a really important topic, but it's told in a frustrating, ham-fisted, flag-waving, clichéd way.                  "
Kick Ass 2,2013,32,                      Fleetingly enjoyable scenes suffer for the overall lack of cohesion. The film would have benefitted from some focus.                  
Our Day Will Come,2010,45,"                      Our Day Will Come is one of those descending-into-madness kinds of films. It is interesting to watch, troubling, and well made. I also didn't like it very much.                  "
Ong Bak 3,2010,50,"                      Ong Bak 3 isn't Ong Bak 1, but there are still plenty of endearing characteristics.                  "
The Veteran,2011,60,                      full review at Movies for the Masses                  
Night Train to Lisbon,2013,43,"                      It’s a swirl of mystery, romance, self-examination, and character study that does at times trip over itself and its subtle but clumsy preachiness.                  "
Mental,2012,44,"                      Heart, humor and hilarity. . .and a big hunting knife! It's great to be ""mental"" if it means loving Mental!                  "
The Matchmaker,2010,88,"                      [The Matchmaker] succeeds on two levels -- as a Middle East coming-of-age fable during a period of cultural change, and a rare view of Holocaust survivors in Israel learning to live and love again.                  "
The Age of Adaline,2015,55,                      A silly movie that takes itself too seriously.                  
Wanderlust,2012,59,                      Rudd illustrates his unchallenging likeability...                  
Wild Oats,2016,0,                      The laughs in this insomnia cure come in the first act                  
Bringing Up Bobby,2011,17,"                      Bringing Up Bobby is strongly recommended for both young teens and adults. It is a film that will help all of us survive and move on, in the beautiful yet uncomfortable world of our own making.                  "
Most Wanted,2020,70,"                      Ultimately, “Most Wanted” is an inherently interesting true story that's told in a way that saps it of its excitement. The bold narrative structure doesn't quite live up to what it's trying to do.                   "
Stolen,2012,19,"                      Aptly named, Stolen is the cinematic equivalent of a synonym, the same movie but different than Taken.                  "
Special Forces,2011,15,                      It's hard to take the proceedings seriously when they can barely hold our interest.                  
The Comedian,2012,50,"                      The Comedian does have moments that feel remarkably true to life... In this instance though, realism does not make for compelling drama and one is left longing for a spark of energy.                  "
The Song of Names,2019,39,"                      A handsome, yet somewhat dreary historical drama that does not hit the emotional notes it needs to succeed.                  "
Freeheld,2015,50,"                      Moore and Page deliver powerful, heartfelt performances in this stirring tribute to an ordinary couple whose love and integrity compelled them to demand equal rights in an extraordinary act of courage.                  "
Sket,2011,50,"                      A film that, for all its grit and attitude, lacks sufficient cred.                  "
The Tall Man,2012,43,                      Trust me the payoff is completely worth it.                  
Spiders,2013,11,"                      The dialogue is terribly generic, the jump scares are predictable, and the gore effects are unconvincing.                  "

Detachment,2011,58,"                      Detachment clearly has high aspirations, but unfortunately its jumbled narration means that it falls just shy of the mark.                  "

Dark Horse,2011,70,"                      This movie feels like a culmination of sorts - it spins right off into extended fantasy for long periods of time, allowing us right inside the sordid funny and downright depressing fantasy life of Abe, king of the losers                  "
Moonstruck,2010,93,"                      Moonstruck made me laugh, as any good comedy should. But this rare and wonderful movie did something more: It also made me smile.

"
The Pill,2011,70,"                      Writer-director J.C. Khoury has sensibility and a refreshing amount of sense, too.                  "
Attenberg,2010,78,"                      The film never feels male gaze-y, and it's refreshing to watch sex and nudity that's awkward (like life off-screen) and even a bit silly.                  "

Mother and Son,2022,75,                      Léonor Serraille’s Mother and Son is a lovely film about feminine strength that also refuses to glorify motherhood.                  
Urbanized,2011,100,"                      Once again, Hustwit has made an invigorating film out of a subject with no flesh or blood, and yet speaks so much to the way we live.                  "
Detention,2011,43,
Northeast,2011,20,"                      Northeast never finds enough direction, or gathers enough oomph, to leave a lasting impression.                  "
The Way He Looks,2014,93,"                      A wonderful film, a truly touching love story that captures growing up in all of its messy, awkward, sometimes painful beauty.                  "
We the Party,2012,28,"                      I have to admit there is something kind of disarming about its corny earnestness. Van Peebles clearly invested himself in the material, and damn it all if he wasn't going to wring that screenplay for all it was worth.                  "
The Big Uneasy,2010,71,"                      The citizens of New Orleans deserve a defense that is more fired up, angrier and more gripping than this somewhat flaccid documentary.                  "
Archaeology of a Woman,2012,43,"                      A lot of good intentions and artistic courage went into Archaeology, but they never come together in a coherent whole.                  "
Broken,2011,72,"                      If you're up for a cerebral thriller, Fracture smartly alludes to story beats from the OJ Simpson case. It gives us an unlikely hero...                  "
Fightville,2011,61,"                      Fightville takes the spotlight out of Las Vegas and shines it on southern Louisiana, taking a hard look at the grueling underside of MMA fighting through the perspectives of four dedicated men.                  "
Vinyl,2012,50,"                      Shot like an 80s BBC kids show, Sugarman's Vinyl really is barrel-scraping stuff.                  "
Genius,2016,52,"                      As Perkins and Wolfe discuss the importance of every choice and omission an artist makes in crafting work, it is sad that Genius doesn't know show much evidence of that same consideration.                  "

Bernie,2011,88,                      Linklater’s film is one of the best comedies and most interesting films of the year.                  
Tabloid,2010,92,"                      While the film contains elements that prove sleazy, at times incredibly funny, but also carry an unquestionable sadness, Morris' camera remains trained on his interview subjects, and he does not judge.                  "
Joshua Tree 1951 A Portrait of James Dean,2012,60,"                      Mishory's film walks the same forlorn street as that of Bruce Weber's 1988 Chet Baker documentary, Let's Get Lost, and shares its palpable fascination for an iconic individual cursed by both beauty and artistic genius.                  "
Nesting,2012,0,
Tarzan,2013,20,"                      Tarzan (brought alive with just the right degree of unsophisticated innocence by Lutz) and Jane, when together in the jungle, are just believable and appealing enough to make the viewer forget the film's weaker elements.                  "
Weekender,2011,9,"                      The perennial problem with party films is that the viewer is made to feel a wallflower, looking on from the sidelines, and director Karl Golden does nothing to dispel that sense of distance here.                  "
Snowpiercer,2013,94,                      This graphic novel adaptation is a blend of science fiction and social commentary that plays out like a video game... With it comes Chris Evans’ finest performance.                  
Lovely Molly,2011,45,                      This sort of mimics the spectrum of stances people take today on the issues of evil and possession in the world. Lovely Molly balances all of these possibilities in a very deft and raw manner.                  
Ready,2011,30,"                      This works in the film's favour: it's loud, crude and unpretentious.                  "
Wunderkinder,2011,100,"                      Regardless of your age, you need to pay attention to the characters during the scene setting of this chilling Holocaust story.                  "
Caroline and Jackie,2012,80,"                      Much of the truth is conveyed in the two leads' performances, both of them itchy and disagreeable in the manner of someone trying to prevent a too-familiar conflict from bubbling up again.                  "
The Conquest,2011,79,"                      Even though this is a politically correct film, it still calls it out like it is without half measures. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
11 11 11,2011,7,"                      Despite a good lead performance and a few cool ideas, 11-11-11 is also packed with a lot of airy chit-chat that either repeats established ideas or simply goes nowhere.                  "
Triple 9,2016,54,"                      Triple 9 is a good film, and an entertaining one, but it involves realising that there was a better film to be made out of its various ingredients than the film we actually got.                  "
The Bay,2012,77,"                      When, after the film and a web search or two, audiences begin to read about the real problems of Chesapeake Bay, Levinson’s intent becomes apparent.                  "
Piranha 3DD,2012,12,"                      The gore is a bit limited at first, while the computer-animated chompers still look terribly fake, but the over-the-top violence soon supplements the routine nakedness.                  "
The Spectacular Now,2013,91,"                      One of the interesting things about “The Spectacular Now” is how it employs several familiar plot points, but it treats each of them with a fresh and prudent sincerity.                  "
The Woman,2011,73,"                      A violent, disturbing skewering of the heteropatriarchy and the subjugation of women defining the inherent misogyny of intergenerational subjugation.                  "
In the Land of Blood and Honey,2011,57,"                      In the Land of Blood and Honey is a surprisingly ambitious, nuanced study of the collision of human psychology with the black-and-white lines war presumes.                  "
Weekend,2011,95,                      Andrew Haigh reinvents the romantic chamber piece with this off-beat pairing...                  
Drift,2013,32,"                      The surfing scenes are exhilarating, the waves more terrifying than anything Eli Roth or James Wan could come up with.                  "
Robinson in Ruins,2010,80,"                      As compared to the intensive wandering of the first two films, Ruins is characterized by a kind of stillness, emphasized by an almost musical structure in terms of its visuals.                  "
The Discoverers,2012,85,                      Feels derivative of every quirky indie dramedy you've ever seen.                  
People Like Us,2012,53,"                      Unfortunately, People Like Us just isn't the fulfilling film that it very well could have been.                  "
The Wise Kids,2011,100,                      Cone is a master of restraint as his storytelling always manages to portray extremely emotional moments without falling onto the crutches of overt melodrama...                  
A Night in the Woods,2011,40,                      For a found footage film this film has so many flaws.                  
Cannibal,2013,67,"                      ""Cannibal"" is not your run of the mill human-flesh-eating film, more a slow burn thriller than exploitation style horror.                  "
Detroit Unleaded,2012,69,"                      Detroit Unleaded, by debut writer-director Rola Nashef, is not a head-on social critique, but it is a warmhearted piece about the complicated interactions between the city's Arab and African American populations.                  "
Give Up Tomorrow,2011,100,"                      Mr. Collins's treatment, though jam packed, leaves one itching to understand more about the bigger picture and the political and social connections involved.                  "
Another Happy Day,2011,46,                      Sam Levinson's comedy primal scream...                  
A Useful Life,2010,94,"                      An intriguing film that raises some interesting issues about the future of exhibition in the digital, mainstream-centric age, whilst not completely working as a piece of dramatic cinema in its own right.                  "
Red Light Revolution,2010,33,"                      Not surprisingly, Voutas's inept movie has yet to find a Chinese distributor. Surprisingly, it has found one here.                  "
Heleno,2011,46,"                      Heleno -- an richly intimate portrait of the man, the myth and the madness of both.                  "
October Baby,2011,25,                      A film that wears its faith on its sleeves yet leaves enough room at the table for all who choose to join in.                  
Hair,2010,82,"                      Visually and musically at least, Hair is done beautifully, faithful to its roots.                  "

Friends with Kids,2011,67,"                      There is no substitute for important things to communicate. Good looks, attractive locations and a handful of brittle, clever lines have never been enough.                  "
Trafficked,2017,29,                      It's a rough watch in parts as things are shown and suggested that should shock and appall everyone. It's a powerful film and should be seen.                  
Unhuman,2022,53,                      Somehow trying to convince us that this is more than just another slapdash zombie rage film takes it into territory that strains even further credulity and only raises the annoyance already peaked with endless shouting and no further ingenuity.                   
The Swell Season,2011,78,"                      Filled with pathos and painful truths, strikingly captured by unsuspecting filmmakers who stumbled into a veritable gold mine of emotional riches.                  "
The Butcher the Chef and the Swordsman,2010,46,
Wasteland,2010,100,                      [Director Lucy] Walker's documentary is an eye-opening trip to a part of the world where garbage serves as liquid currency for people who salvage dignity from degradation with intelligence and grace.                  
Last Days Here,2011,86,"                      ...well-made and interesting music documentary about an important and influential band, it is even more impressive as a first hand account of the ravages of drug addiction.                  "
Shame,2011,79,                      Follows an arc familiar from numerous other films that deal with the theme of addiction — an accelerated freefall towards rock bottom followed by self-awareness and a hint of redemption.                  
London Town,2016,53,                      Formulaic writing is lifted to a higher level by a talented ensemble plus real stand out performances from Huttlestone and Rhys Meyers - even if their scenes together are contrived.                  
Innocence,2013,19,"                      Innocence feels much more inspired than most films of its ilk, even if it's not wholly successful. At least do the film a favor and ignore the appalling poster art.                  "
Beyond Skyline,2017,67,"                      If you grew up on 1990's action films and want a taste of that glory again, watch this movie and relive the days...thank you for this, Liam O'Donnell.                  "
Penumbra,2011,60,"                      There's talent here, but Villanueva, like a young artist still influenced by his elders, needs to find his own style or he'll become a skilled yet unexciting copyist.                  "
Hunky Dory,2011,54,"                      Isn't trying to be anything more than it simply is, a kindhearted film about a friendly, progressive minded teacher helping kids explore emotions through art.                  "
The Way Way Back,2013,84,                      It’s refreshingly honest and surprisingly funny. There are also some fabulous characters brought to life through some good acting led by Rockwell.                  
How to Stop Being a Loser,2011,0,                      About as funny and erotic as a young Conservatives speed-dating evening chaperoned by Ann Widdecombe.                  
My Amityville Horror,2012,73,"                      The resulting documentary is, at times, unnerving, but more often a subjective exercise that reveals one of America's most famous hauntings to be an overblown façade.                  "
Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse,2015,44,"                      This critic is tired of seeing movies in which teenage boys behave awfully for two acts, only to be redeemed in the last few moments by some imbalanced act of kindness.                  "

Mercenaries,2011,0,                      The plot and dialogue is borderline ridiculous and the absence of acting Oscar nominations is not exactly a scandal.                  
Bol Bachchan,2012,71,"                      Bol Bachchan, less blaring than your standard Rohit Shetty comedy, can give you sporadic chuckles, and a few helpess laughs. Can't expect more.                  "
Teddy Bear,2012,94,                      A familiar formula with some finely wrought characters we can't help but wish the best for.                  
For the Love of Money,2012,0,"                      Viewers have traveled this road of criminal menace before, only this time it's peppered with more exclamations of 'L'chaim!'                  "
Supernova,2014,10,                      ...a familiar yet promising setup that’s employed to predominantly underwhelming effect...                  
Coma,2022,78,"                      It’s a pandemic film, but one that actually engages with the emotional issues at the heart of fragmentation and separation.                  "
Barely Lethal,2015,26,                      Attempts to subvert some of the standard tropes never really come off and it's light on laughs...                  
Entangled,2019,33,                      This film has enough atmosphere for two movies. The sight and sound of the story are sensually presented. But when it is all over you find there was no real substance to any of it.                  
Khodorkovsky,2011,90,                      Frank and revealing.                  
Atrocious,2010,56,                      there just isn't enough substance to stretch it out to a feature-length film                  
Eden,2012,85,"                      Eden may function as an inauspicious window into the distressing real world of sex works, but its underlying story not only deserves but positively demands a far more considerate and attentive approach than is shown here.                  "
Public Speaking,2010,92,"                      Nonetheless, this is high-brow entertainment of the wittiest order---a little cold, but so what?                  "
Unlocked,2017,26,"                      The film is made less awful, bordering into watchable, thanks solely to it's cast -- though they admittedly mostly phone in their performances.                  "
The Color Wheel,2011,78,                      Alex Ross Perry has defined himself as one of the more exciting new directors with The Color Wheel.                  
Section 8,2022,31,"                      All would be forgiven if the action was top notch, but instead it’s merely serviceable. ... A case of a young director calling their shot, or pure hubris? Possibly a bit of both.                  "
Supercapitalist,2012,17,"                      The film's most impressive performances are turned in by Linus Roache, in what amounts to a relatively brief role, and the gifted Kathy Uyen.                  "
A Girl and a Gun,2013,33,"                      Overall, though, the film does portray the relationship between women and guns with nuance-and despite misgivings about gun ownership as a method of personal protection-is a welcome reprieve from the usual cinematic depictions of gun use.                  "
Darwin,2011,80,"                      Depending on how you look at it, Darwin is either an affirmative record of proud outliers getting by on true grit or a grim snapshot of a community on its last, buckling legs.                  "
Francine,2012,60,"                      While it's audacious on the part of the filmmakers (and of Leo) to keep Francine at arm's length from us, it makes the film a frustrating experience.                  "
The Tunnel,2011,100,                      I was pleasantly surprised by this movie mostly because it was kind of minimalist in ways that most found-footage - and I have seen most of them - simply are not.                  
Addiction Incorporated,2011,72,"                      Charles Evans Jr., making his directorial debut, tries to liven up this old story with re-enactments. But the animated segments he inserts come off as goofy, not gripping.                  "
"Oslo, August 31st",2011,97,"                      In films that are different in style, Joachim Trier shares with Claude Sautet this idea of ​​filming life, a life, in which in the end we add and subtract, to arrive at a barely approximate idea of ​​whether it was worth living or not.                  "
The Aviary,2022,63,                      Chris Cullari and Jennifer Raite show a strong understanding of the persuasive methods cults utilize and empathy for those trapped within them.                    
Just 45 Minutes from Broadway,2012,18,"                      Having already worked on four of Jaglom's films with more on the way, the Iowa-born Frederick has an uncanny knack for matching rhythms with her scene partners.                  "
Mere Brother Ki Dulhan,2011,50,                      Mere Brother Ki Dulhan is a strictly-by-the-template rom com.                  
Bigfoot: The Lost Coast Tapes,2012,50,"                      What it lacks in scares, it makes up for in sheer competence - which frankly is more than can be said about a lot of its ilk.                  "
My Reincarnation,2011,73,"                      The film's unforced nature yields more good than not, treating Namkai's brush with cancer and Yeshi's response with a quiet dignity as well as filling the film with Zen-like imagery of waves crashing at the beach and sunsets that seem wholly organic.                  "
Secret in Their Eyes,2015,39,"                      The remake, however watchable and solidly made it may be, doesn't explore its themes thoroughly.                  "
Cowboy,2011,75,"                      Considering its two male leads and the usually dependable direction of Delmer Daves, Cowboy remains a curious, if ultimately underwhelming Western.                  "
Explorer,2022,100,"                      You know that guy, the salt-and-pepper-haired dude hawking “Dos Equis” beer on TV, online, and in thousands of subsequent memes? The one who is touted as being “The Most Interesting Man in the World?” He can’t hold a candle to Ranulph Fiennes.                  "
Les Lyonnais,2011,50,"                      An easy film to fall for -- it's slick, proficient and has just enough depth to lift it above your average, humdrum crime drama.                  "
Americano,2011,50,"                      Compelling in places, and gorgeous-looking all the way through. But what starts as an absorbing meditation on one man's struggle with his personal heritage soon dissolves into something else, and the second thing is a lot less interesting.                  "
Sabotage,2014,22,"                      Part murder mystery, part cop actioner, and mishandled with a touch of Western justice, the film never finds even footing and stumbles throughout its messy presentation, which is punctuated by bloody violence and a pervasive macho attitude.                  "
Guilty of Romance,2011,67,"                      Too serious for entertainment yet too bizarre to be taken too seriously, ""Guilty of Romance"" would be a drag to watch if not for the truly stellar acting by its two eye-catching female leads.                  "
The Wall,2012,77,                      Pölsler has created a captivating and emotionally compelling parable which harks back to an era when popular sci-fi functioned as a thoughtful and vital study of contemporary issues.                  
Gore Vidal: The United States of Amnesia,2013,83,
The Tribe,2014,88,"                      Impressively commanding audience commitment to its increasingly disturbing narrative, it's a compelling scenario suggesting the universally understood ordeal of finding out true love is blind.                  "
Crime After Crime,2011,91,"                      Shot over the course of five years by Yoav Potash, takes us from the beginning.                  "
"Small, Beautifully Moving Parts",2011,50,                      Lazy storytelling expects a pass as indie authenticity.                  
Wish Me Away,2011,93,"                      Wright came out, first and foremost, to live an honest life. We have no choice but to commend her on it after the film, once we've already watched her cry and lose her temper and lose control.                  "
Blood Ties,2013,52,"                      It does manage to be an engrossing faux saga, nonetheless, despite a handful of foibles that work against its success.                  "
Hell and Back Again,2011,100,"                      Hell And Back Again will leave you with a tense chest, and a new sense of appreciation for the freedoms we have here in the U.S. and the soldiers that allow us to have them, despite your feelings on the war.                  "
Red Lights,2012,30,                      All of the actors in this impressive cast deserve better than the cornball paranormal yarn they’re ultimately a part of.                  
The Collection,2012,36,"                      Some scenes not only ask us to suspend disbelief, they ask us to suspend rationality.                  "
Tiger Eyes,2012,63,"                      The film fundamentally misunderstands what makes the book so effective (strange, considering its writers). The focus on a traditional YA romance betrays both the mother/daughter relationship and sidelines the nuanced examination of grief.                  "
NOiSE,2022,100,"                      Although we are at all times searching for Julia's daughter, it's not always clear where we are or how we got there, which allows the film's momentum to flag repeatedly.                  "
Resident Evil: Damnation,2012,100,"                      It's a unique spin on a good traditional setting, and is a very fun watch, especially if you're a fan of the game series...                  "
Buck,2011,90,                      How did no one think to make a documentary about this guy before?                  
David,2011,100,"                      David is honest and relatable, and ultimately triggers a response of tolerance and compassion.                  "
Detour,2013,56,                      An agonizing ordeal.                  
The Iran Job,2012,90,                      The film's truly profound moments arise out of Kevin's befriending a physiotherapist named Hilda.                  
Las Acacias,2011,84,"                      A small and amazingly rich movie, but its 85 minutes passed as if they were no time at all, and I immediately wanted to see it again, so much did it tap into the experience of being alive in the moment.                  "
Leave It on the Floor,2011,70,"                      While Larry's film certainly sports a pulsing rhythm in some of its excellent musical numbers, it unfortunately exhibits a distracting amount of low budget hallmarks that weigh it down as a run-of-the-mill niche picture.                  "
Life in Movement,2011,100,"                      Wim Wenders's Pina, about the late Pina Bausch, has set the bar high. This one is worth treasuring, in the same canon.                  "
Madame X,2010,60,"                      Madame X is an emotional Grand Guignol, a hysterical soap opera that would end up being the final and potentially most memorable hour of Lana Turner.                  "
Michael,2011,80,"                      ...Michael boasts a deliberate, clinical atmosphere that handily evokes the feel of Haneke's hit-and-miss body of work...                  "
Post Tenebras Lux,2012,53,"                      It's not enjoyable, it's not challenging. It's only frustrating.                  "
Servitude,2011,60,"                      Every element is played to its maximum comedic potential, whether it's politically correct or ridiculously over-the-top.                  "
The Collector,2006,60,"                      Olympia tries to impose order on a loosely shaped series of interviews with and about her dad via voice-over narration, but her trivial, self-absorbed musings only make the film seem more like an accomplished home movie than a serious documentary.                  "
The Little Prince,2015,92,"                      The actual story it's telling becomes such a footnote in this pat-itself-on-the-back, self-congratulatory thing going on and on about ""here's the story of the Little Prince, wasn't it a GREAT story? Weren't we brilliant for sharing that story with you?""                  "
The Sea,2013,52,"                      Often seen as one of the world's finest character actors, Hinds pours heart and soul into this performance, and the results are devastating.                  "
Waiting for Lightning,2012,45,"                      May not be of interest to everyone, but Way's classic rags-to-riches tale of prevailing will is a heartwarming story anyone should be able to get behind.                  "
Fake It So Real,2011,91,                      Outsider artists don't expect to be discovered; they just want to share their passion with the world. Greene's film communicates their devotion -- and their desire to hit people on the back with steel chairs.                  
Starbuck,2011,65,"                      If there's a lesson in Starbuck, I believe, it's that ""family"" is essential and what that means is different for everyone.                  "
Twixt,2011,29,"                      A strange, snickering and sometimes terribly sad picture that deserved a better audience.                  "
Mitt,2014,83,                      It's this ambivalence toward actually being President that comes across as one of the most revealing parts of Mitt.                  
Bombay Beach,2011,77,                      Har'el is neither overly sympathetic nor detached.                  
Diana,2013,7,                      Diana turns out to be an enormously tedious character study which never once has the balls to go beyond its glossed-up TV movie roots.                  
Unconditional,2012,75,"                      A deeply moving film that is also thought provoking, inspiring, and impossible to forget.                  "
Life Just Is,2012,23,"                      LIFE JUST IS is a decent film, possessing wit and intelligence (alongside some above average acting) but it will be hard for the film to persist in the memory, as a result of the slightly whiny concerns of the otherwise very likeable characters.                  "
The To Do List,2013,56,                      It's a small thrill with big implications.                  
The Snowman,2017,6,"                      None of it proves engaging, regardless of the fine-looking production and solid cast.                  "
Charlie Says,2018,59,"                      Harron's thoughtful, psychologically complex approach to films about killers and pinup models have a way of undermining the subject's inherent salaciousness.                  "
"Nancy, Please",2012,89,"                      Not all of Nancy, Please feels quite successful, but there's a gleeful glint of menace unspooling throughout most of the film's running time.                  "
Codependent Lesbian Space Alien Seeks Same,2011,93,"                      The word campy does come to mind, but it's rather miraculous and satisfying that the film's camp is never done at the expense of its characters.                  "
One Life,2011,90,"                      Even if we can understand that the future of our planet depends on a multi-species sharing economy, the film doesn't always match up what it says with what it shows.                  "
Walking with Dinosaurs 3D,2013,23,"                      With cringe-worthy dialogue and a long and unnecessary story, there's nothing about this film that stands out, which unfortunately shames the late '90s BBC series from which it originates.                  "
No One Lives,2012,48,"                      More often than not, the film skips from one dull cliché to another, even as it attempts to launch a massive series of laughably implausible twists.                  "
The First Time,2012,47,"                      While the film is not worthy of abject dismissal, as Kasdan is at least trying to give us something that feels genuine, it's still predictable, still one note, and still features two main characters that aren't particularly thrilling to watch.                  "
The Theatre Bizarre,2011,38,"                      ""The Theatre Bizarre"" is reminiscent of many of the horror compendiums that preceded it. An up and down and down mish mash of styles and sub genres, overall this is a fun, dark, gory, intriguing, addition to the fold.                  "
Arbitrage,2012,87,"                      Without Richard Gere at the center, Jarecki’s film wouldn’t work so well.                  "
Best Laid Plans,2012,50,                      A cut above recent British low-life crime pictures...                  
Dear Mandela,2012,100,"                      The subject matter is very sensitively handled by filmmakers Dara Kell and Christopher Nizza, who choose their subjects wisely and don't sentimentalise the situation.                  "
The Deep,2012,94,"                      Ólafur Darri Ólafsson is spectacular in such a difficult performance, one that purely relies on body language to show the depths of pain this guy went through to survive.                  "
Donor Unknown,2010,91,                      [A]s cheery and bittersweet and lovely-melancholy as can be...                  
Here I Am,2011,67,"                      This kind of tragedy can be oppressive, but there's moments of beautiful comedy - mostly from Betty Sumner's Anita - and inviting moments of warmth.                  "
Upside Down: The Creation Records Story,2010,100,                      Debutant director O'Connor's lively documentary goes some way to capturing the eclectic and eccentric nature of the label's management and recording artists.                  
Clean,2022,46,"                      Clean waffles between being a conventional action film like Death Wish (1974) and Scorsese's social parable [Taxi Driver, 1976]. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
Trap for Cinderella,2013,25,"                      The plot is ludicrously far-fetched, but despite some plodding dialogue, committed performances from leads Tuppence Middleton and Alexandra Roach make this tale of jealousy and betrayal a heady treat.                  "
Under the Influence,2022,73,                      Never warmed up to the vlogger's shtick.                  
388 Arletta Avenue,2011,56,                      388 Arletta Avenue involves the modern terror of knowing a certain percentage of murder and violent crime's still committed by total strangers.                  
Silent House,2011,68,"                      Florencia Colucci is superb, easily shouldering the film. Also impressive is some genuine creepiness courtesy of clever lighting.                  "
Shadow Dancer,2012,84,                      The director gives the film a strong personal touch that makes all the difference.                  
Stonehearst Asylum,2014,54,"                      Far-fetched but entertaining, Stonehearst Ayslum is an enjoyable gothic thriller with a wonderful eerie tone which is assuredly directed by Brad Anderson.                  "
Foxfire: Confessions of a Girl Gang,2012,68,"                      Whereas Cantet's decision to use non-professional actors paid dividends in The Class, it seems to have quite the opposite effect on this occasion, with few of the young performers leaving much of a mark.                  "
Danny Collins,2015,78,"                      Though riddled with clichés, there are memorable performances from Pacino, Annette Bening as his lover and Christopher Plummer as his sardonic manager.                  "
Wreck-It Ralph,2012,87,"                      Phil Johnston and Jennifer Lee’s script finds sad, trapped, silly characters locked inside their programming and desperate to escape, and in these energetic and colorful settings, losing yourself in their struggle for freedom and acceptance is effortless.                  "
The Catechism Cataclysm,2011,47,"                      The film is kind of a road trip, kind of a voyage of self-discovery, and kind of an ""Apocalypse Now"" style journey into a chaotic, surreal hell.                  "
Trade of Innocents,2012,0,                      A middling thriller wrapped around a compelling lecture about the child sex trade in Southeast Asia...                  
Outside Bet,2012,0,"                      Tension in the final section is never enough to send pulses galloping, making this more of a trot over well-trodden ground than a hot tip.                  "
Mara,2018,28,"                      A crime thriller and supernatural horror about the unnerving experiences of people with sleep paralysis. Plenty in its favor, but nowhere near enough.                  "
The Punk Syndrome,2012,94,"                      Somewhere in this footage there is a brilliant story of overcoming adversity through the acceptance of the classically outcast, but what is here feels lazy, incomplete, and somewhat exploitative.                  "
Porfirio,2011,67,                      Insider view of would-be terrorist activity quietly but forcefully packs a punch.                  
Bobby Fischer Against the World,2011,88,                      A great introduction to this once-in-a-generation player.                  
Rosaline,2022,74,                      …Rosaline passes muster as an amusing update on the classic story that at least questions the assumptions that we casually make about the values within Shakespeare’s plays…                  
Demons Never Die,2011,13,                      The overly familiar can make for an entertaining ride all the same with the right amount of slick style and intelligent inspiration.                  
The Ultimate Life,2013,18,"                      'The Ultimate Life' is an awkward, mostly dull, but well-intentioned faith-based movie, among the less-than-stellar offerings that, unfortunately, often presented to the sadly under-served faith-based audience that deserves thoughtful screenplays.                  "
Lord Byron,2011,71,                      A film that sometimes feels like performance art or a spoken word performance.                  
Aftershock,2012,39,"                      While hospitals send out anodyne statements that ""every death is a tragedy"" without taking responsibility, these families show in detail the emotional costs of systemic bias.                  "
Clown,2014,44,"                      While competently made and demonstrating Watts' assured talent, the story and characters fail to engage in any way outside of disturbing us.                  "
Holy Rollers: The True Story of Card Counting Christians,2011,100,                      It's sort of a Michael Moore meets Morgan Spurlock glimpse inside the world of The Church Team.                  
Seberg,2019,35,                      As insightful as the shallow end of a swimming pool                  
Wilson,2017,47,"                      Harrelson and Dern's performances inevitably outshine their source material, as the film's sloppy third act will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth.                  "
Anna Karenina,2012,62,"                      While even skilled filmmakers would have trouble adapting Tolstoy’s novel in a straightforward form, Wright attempts a book-to-stage-to-film approach and, for the first time in his career, stretched his considerable talent thin.                  "
Burn,2012,100,                      Burn lets us inside a world we wouldn't otherwise see -- it's far too dangerous for most of us. But these admirable men wouldn't have it any other way.                  
No Escape,2015,48,                      “No Escape” makes it easy to overlook its shortcomings because you’ll be so fiercely absorbed in the next stressful encounter.                   
Hail,2011,71,"                      What starts out as a promising drama...quickly dissolves into an ugly, unpleasant character portrait about an unrepentant brute who prefers to scream at the world rather than confront it.                  "
Letters from the Big Man,2011,86,"                      Munch never quite reconciles his psychological and environmental themes, but his characters are so richly imagined and the location photography (by his regular cinematographer, Rob Sweeney) is so gorgeous that the movie still casts a rare spell.                  "
Union Square,2011,66,"                      At a running time of 80 minutes, Union Square runs into some threadbare patches, but nothing that isn't quickly dissipated by a passionately endearing performance from Sorvino.                  "
Players,2012,43,"                      Music by Pritam is good while it lasts. Some editing sorely needed, visual imagery quite polished, and the look as usual is of new age Bollywood.                  "
Deviation,2012,13,"                      In Buried, Ryan Reynolds spends the whole film underground in a coffin - child's play compared to what Anna Walton is put through here. She spends an entire night locked in a car with Danny Dyer - while he acts at her.                  "
Resurrection,2010,17,"                      If this sounds like a knockoff of Se7en, that's because it is.                  "
The Punk Singer,2013,91,"                      What was most refreshing, though, was getting to see sides of Hanna's personality that aren't always immediately apparent from interviews and stage banter.                  "
The Vault,2017,27,                      Extremely predictable... there is something that happens that it just gives it everything away very easily.                  
Family Portrait in Black and White,2011,90,"                      It's a fascinating story, fascinatingly told.                  "
Jess + Moss,2011,80,                      Jess + Moss is a simply beautiful film with amazing sound work and nearly flawless direction.

Uncle Kent,2011,60,"                      ""Hi, where have you been all my life?"" may be learned behavior, but it always sounds good up close... [A] sense of life-just-happens and what-the-------just-happened, those instants just before cheeks flush and unwelcome memories etch.                  "
Kill List,2011,78,"                      An element of the occult, of some sinister, unknown outside force encroaching on the narrative, driving characters closer and closer to the brink of madness.                  "
Forget Me Not,2010,69,"                      Fans of Menzies, O'Reilly, and Jones will probably want to see Forget Me Not for their work here. Lovers of London may want to see the film for its fabulous shots of the city. It just is not a movie for those seeking a plausible cinematic romance.                  "
Murph: The Protector,2013,78,"                      The story of Lt. Michael P. Murphy's life doesn't need to be hyped, and Murph: The Protector does a good job of staying out of its way.                  "
The Other F Word,2011,78,                      A film that should have its own special place among rock n' roll documentaries.                  
Struck by Lightning,2012,32,"                      Brian Dannelly's direction keeps the film clean, simple. A softness to the visual tone of the film both in lighting and use of color serves as a nice balance to the harsh realities and high school!                  "
Weekend,2011,95,                      Andrew Haigh reinvents the romantic chamber piece with this off-beat pairing...                  
Without,2011,90,"                      Jackson shows a lot of promise as a director, based on this debut.                  "
Cirque du Soleil: Worlds Away,2012,45,"                      Soaringly pointless. No point to it whatsoever. I looked. I looked everywhere for a point, even under my cinema seat. But I came up empty-handed. It's 90 minutes of sheer, total, utter pointlessness.                  "
Shakedown,2018,100,                      The grainy look adds an immersive texture to the film...                  
Wild Bill,2011,100,"                      Like its central character, this comedy-drama is a likable underdog in the collection of black-humored British crime movies influenced by the likes of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.                  "
My First Wedding,2011,0,"                      Even with the utterly gorgeous Cooke, this film stinks.                  "
Savannah,2013,13,                      Some beautifully photographed landscape shots are the only aspect of interest in this bewilderingly bland exercise.                  
Downtown Express,2011,55,"                      Marked by wide-eyed charm, though not particularly adroit -- a marginal pan, owing to its somewhat lazy and functional narrative. Still, its music, from Philippe Quint and Nellie McKay, absolutely sings.                  "
From Up on Poppy Hill,2011,87,"                      Poppy Hill” is beautiful, but more dull than expected. It would be nice to see Goro Miyazaki engage in stories that actually resonate with him, rather than to follow his father’s script (or footsteps).                  "
This Is Martin Bonner,2013,93,"                      Director Chad Hartigan's hopeful approach to the material, combined with the terrific cast and cinematography, come together to make this one of 2013's quiet triumphs.                  "
Bad Santa 2,2016,23,"                      While the foul language, misanthropic attitude, and cynical performances still come into focus, even squinting might not pick up much in the way of the first film's clever plotting, genuine wit, and sneaky subversive streak running throughout.                  "
Firestarter,2022,10,"                      This was Firestarter, turgid Firestarter  Unwanted Firestarter, dire Firestarter  Pointless Firestarter, one star Firestarter                  "
Southpaw,2015,60,"                      The entire film hinges on Gyllenhaal, because everything else onscreen adopts the worn-out blueprints of every boxing film you've ever seen.                  "
Joanna,2010,20,                      A monument to cheap ambition.                  
Benji,2018,60,                      Updated dog tale has realistic peril and violence.                  
American Hustle,2013,92,"                      “American Hustle” is more of a showcase of great actors than it is great storytelling, but it still keeps you glued to the screen as you watch them do their work.                  "
Brooklyn Castle,2012,96,                      I cannot recommend this highly enough. You will find hope in a new generation of teenagers and a desire to see education thrive in our country again.                  
Gold,2016,41,                      A movie that is completely hollow and only saved by Matthew McConaughey's committed performance.                  
Turkey Bowl,2011,70,"                      The dialogue is hilarious and real, ranging from playful jabs between characters to insults masking deeper resentments to the dumb braggadocio that only comes after knowing someone a long time.                  "
Better Than Something: Jay Reatard,2011,80,"                      Better Than Something isn't bad, but it never really gets to the bottom of Reatard's anger issues.                  "
Beyond,2012,81,"                      If Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome doesn't live up to the pace and power of its predecessors, its richer visual style and more substantial storyline and characterizations, are a welcome, if not wholly successful, change in emphasis.                   "
Me and You,2012,67,                      The film never elevates beyond a sometimes ungainly and trifling exploration of themes and relationships exhibited more daringly and memorably in other works.                  
Gotti,2018,0,"                      Mob movies can make for great cinema. But, curiosity isnt by itself worthy of art, which makes Gotti more informational than good.                  "
The Hater,2022,90,"                      Generally, I found The Hater charming and lovable.                  "
The Lady,2011,36,"                      His story telling clings hard to sentimentality rather than historical facts, but thanks to an Oscar worthy performance by Yeoh and a stark realism...The Lady makes for a powerful, if not weighty, biopic.                  "
Sound It Out,2011,93,"                      It is lovely; full of heart, affection and thoughtfulness.                  "
Girl Model,2011,92,"                      Redmon and Sabin have created an unflinching film, with their cameras deeply fixed on the subject matter and refusing to turn away.                  "

As Luck Would Have It,2011,38,"                      A great looking film, its ancient Roman amphitheater a perfect stage for its tragicomic contents. Unfortunately, it's completely devoid of sparks of any kind.                  "
Jackpot,2011,59,"                      As Nordic imports go, it's hardly as offensive as lutefisk.                  "
Ecstasy,2011,15,"                      A drug-fueled landscape impacted by the Thatcher years, characterized by Scottish working class misery and massive unemployment feeding the underground drug economy.

Unbroken,2014,52,                      “Unbroken” is a competent and well-intentioned movie centered around an inspiring true story.                  
On the Sly,2011,100,"                      A compelling, wholly original tale marred a bit by its young heroine's incessant chatter on the soundtrack.                  "
Little Boy,2015,25,                      There's an earnestness that simply can't be denied.                  
Meeting Evil,2012,13,"                      It features tons of poor decisions, from the overwrought and intrusive musical score to bad-joke one liners from the main characters down to the supporting ones. The worst decision either actor made was actually appearing in this awful film.                  "
The Salt of Life,2011,84,                      The appeal of The Salt of Life lies in Gregorio's ability to imbue his film with an amusing sense of natural playfulness.                  
Admission,2013,39,"                      If Admission had become an edgier film, I have a strange feeling that we'd be watching yet another really great Tina Fey comedy.                  "
Gerontophilia,2013,50,                      This really is a small revolution here. Making us see the world differently than we came to it eighty-two minutes earlier.

The National Parks Project,2011,100,"                      As with any omnibus work, the components are somewhat uneven. But some are brilliant. It's like looking at the results of a a life-drawing class that has, as its subject, the best parts of the whole country laid bare.                  "
The Aggression Scale,2012,100,"                      You kind of have to buy in to what The Aggression Scale is selling in order to enjoy this film. And I did, so I did.                  "
A Case of You,2013,47,"                      With all the obvious flaws, A Case of You is still very entertaining and enjoyable.                  "
The Place Beyond the Pines,2012,78,"                      Cianfrance never allows his viewers to escape the heartbreak of his film, consuming us with a resounding feeling of sorrow over these characters and the way their lives set paths for one another.                  "

War Witch,2012,94,"                      That the teenage Rachel Mwanza can show us, and make us feel viscerally, a bit of what such a child goes through is a miracle in itself.                  "
Patagonia Rising,2011,50,                      A documentary that makes a good case against the building of five large dams in Chile designed to make a profit for European investors.                  
The Ballad of Genesis and Lady Jaye,2011,67,"                      The result is a movie where actions that might seem, at a cursory glance, to be radical to the point of madness become perfectly rational expressions of that crazy thing called love.                  "
The Nut Job,2014,13,"                      Strictly one for the kids, the animated heist flick The Nut Job zips by thanks to its nonstop barrage of family-friendly mayhem.                  "
8 Murders a Day,2011,57,"                      [Although it's] somewhat repetitive and not terribly well-organized, it shines an important light on what the filmmaker deems ""the greatest human rights disaster in the world today.""                  "
Mateo,2014,63,"                      Mateo won't do much for an average viewer, but those interested in the subject matter will find themselves having a good time with it.                  "
My Best Enemy,2011,18,"                      While the film generates some mild suspense and the period re-creation is convincing enough, the twists eventually become more contrived and preposterous.                  "
House of Darkness,2022,60,"                      House of Darkness is where male privilege finds edgy accommodation from a vindictive sisterhood – & this increasingly vicious clinch of the sexes yields nightmarish Holocaust imagery alongside more conventional, if partly modernised, gothic furnishings.                   "
Flying Blind,2012,50,"                      Flying Blind introduces yet another new and exciting female filmmaker with a distinctive voice, and she's equally complimented by a stunning turn from her lead actress.                  "
Love Life,2022,85,"                      A somber spirit propels “Love Life,” a vital melodrama about the difficulty of moving on.                  "
Annie,2014,28,                      An attempt to recreate an icon for a new age but falls flatter than Miss Hannigan's high notes.                  
Chappie,2015,32,"                      Blomkamp’s film contains a concept ripe with possibility, but instead of realizing its full potential, he loses himself in machines and mayhem.                  "
Song Without a Name,2019,93,                      A solid debut by Peruvian director Melina León. [Full review in Spanish]                  
The Double,2013,84,"                      Rather than a faithful modernization of Dostoyevsky, the source material is a springboard for this creative young director to engage in some very ambitious, very intellectual filmmaking.                  "
The Surrogate,2020,95,                      It’s a lightweight treatment of some serious issues that can border on antic sitcom-style contrivance. But the performers are expert...                  
Black Panther,2018,96,                      Wakanda Forever is the big screen outing that has all the elements to give you a larger than life cinematic experience.                   
Mike,2011,78,"                      As always, Soderbergh’s treatment manages to make familiar material into something that surprises us when we realize how emotionally involved we’ve become.                  "
Paradise,2011,21,"                      Paradise claims to be the story of young woman's crisis of faith and subsequent rebirth, but in execution, it feels more like a story about someone who was in a bad mood for a while but eventually got over it.                  "
Paint It Black,2017,88,"                      If that sounds a bit florid, then you've got the idea. Paint It Black is purple and overcooked, swelling to burst with rococo emotion. It doesn't always hold together but it's too outstanding to be ignored.                  "
Mad As Hell,2014,27,"                      A slick-looking doc, but its storytelling is decidedly conventional: the talking head interviews serve their purpose, and the backstage footage is interesting, but none of it feels as spontaneous, alive and dangerous as Uygur.                  "
About Last Night,2014,69,"                      Frisky and a little freaky, but not as funny or insightful as it thinks it is.                  "
Green,2011,80,"                      Articularly acute as a character study of a young woman overcome with emotions she doesn't entirely understand and yet a film that grows well beyond the frame, lingering in thoughts long after leaving the theater.                  "
Life of the Party,2018,38,"                      The comedy consistently works, with McCarthy showing off her versatility as a performer.                  "
Captivated: The Trials of Pamela Smart,2014,75,"                      No one gets away from 'Captivated' clean: not the viewer, not the participants, not even the filmmaker.                  "
Petunia,2012,20,"                      With honesty, conviction, humor, and insight, Christian and his cast and crew have created what is easily one of summer 2013's best films.                  "
Padre Pio,2022,44,"                      But even with its flaws, Padre Pio can be recognized as an admirable and deeply personal effort — for both its director and its star — that still packs the occasional cinematic punch.                  "
Harvest,2011,73,"                      It's safe to say that 'Harvest' is a modest film, but those are often the ones that pull on our emotions the most.                  "
Relative,2022,100,"                      While some instances feel more organic than others, none are completely out of place conceptually and all end up providing another springboard towards subdued yet entertaining levity by way of communion or juxtaposition.                  "
Tales of the Night,2011,80,"                      Without doubt, Ocelot's Tales of the Night has a great deal of charm.                  "
The Gambler,2015,43,"                      By the end, it's difficult to care about Jim as Wahlberg represents him.                  "
Make Your Move,2013,38,                      Its lack of sparks on the dance floor are matched by the sense of alienation when the dancing stops.                  
Evidence,2013,6,"                      Evidence suggests that there's a much better film lurking under the surface here, but the one we get results in, at best, a hung jury.                  "
Passion,2012,33,"                      All the director’s themes are at play in Passion: obsession, voyeurism, eroticism, murder, and the warped mind of a killer—they’re all present. But they never come alive in the sensational way they do in his best films.                  "
Joffrey: Mavericks of American Dance,2012,55,"                      The pace never lags leaving the viewer wanting more, never less than what has been presented.                  "
Winter in the Blood,2013,67,"                      Though the narrative meanders and often feels too elliptical for its own good, the film is a character piece delivered as a languid tone poem, life as a bramble weed drifting simultaneously to freedom and trouble.                  "
Death of Me,2020,31,"                      Death of Me is a mind-bogglingly tedious bit of vaguely racist horseshit that is devoid of chills, thrills, or even cheap gore.                  "
Dreams,2011,68,"                      The movie, an eight-part trance, is beautiful but disconnected.                   "
I Am Eleven,2011,79,                      A bad film with good intentions.                  
A Separation,2011,99,                      It touches on a reality of life that transcends any political or cultural barrier while also offering some thought-provoking insight into the religious laws and social structure of that part of the world.                  
The Informer,2019,64,"                      “The Informer” nimbly plays within its gritty crime genre, maintaining a propulsive pace that keeps its audience on their toes. It all tangibly plays out within the moral malaise of underworld violence and crooked law enforcement.                  "
Berberian Sound Studio,2012,86,"                      Berberian Sound Studio is definitely unique with some wonderful moments that nail what Strickland is going for, but it's too uneven to be something truly great.                  "
Angels Sing,2013,29,"                      Angels Sing certainly isn't for everyone, but for those seeking something different for the holiday viewing it's a winning film.                  "
Errors of the Human Body,2012,75,"                      Errors Of The Human Body is a thought-provoking, slow burn thriller that speaks to the moral conscience within each of us when it comes to science versus ethics and playing God.                  "

Hyena,2014,78,                      This nasty horror sucks you into a grisly world of duplicitous cops and brutish criminals prepared to butcher anyone who gets in their way.                  
War of the Buttons,2011,25,"                      This ""family adventure"" is exactly the type of yarn made for adults too uncomfortable with revealing the truth of a cruel world to the little beings they've brought into it.                  "

Juan of the Dead,2011,83,                      Juan of the Dead is a huge laugh at the Cuban revolution.

Free Ride,2013,14,"                      It's unspeakably depressing to see Anna Paquin playing the mom (of a teenager!), but the pointlessness and mediocrity of the Paquin-produced ""Free Ride"" is even more depressing.                  "
Ruby Sparks,2012,79,"                      The setup may be ancient in origin, but the treatment is sophisticated, beguiling, insightful, and brimming with charm.                  "

Rockstar,2011,83,"                      The fact that this romance unfolds on screen in the form of an explosive musical, capturing JJ's transmutation into Jordan, the edgy artist, makes the film an absolutely engaging affair.                  "
Sleepless Nights Stories,2011,67,"                      It proves that Mekas is still very much awake, contemplating the broad gulfs of the past and future, the little life that, as Shakespeare put it, ""is rounded with a sleep.""                  "
The Magic of Belle Isle,2012,29,                      Hopeless drivel.                  
Divergent,2014,41,                      There have been far more compelling metaphors for the trials of adolescence.                  
The Words,2012,24,                      Bradley Cooper has really got to stop doing bad things for the sake of writing.                  
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,2014,90,"                      The increasingly difficult struggle of Steve Rogers upholding his vow to remain a good man while wading through so much villainy achieves great resonance and this tremendously entertaining film, the MCU's best, is as interested in testing mettle as metal.                  "
Inescapable,2012,17,                      A joyless exercise in prevailing generality.                  
Mekong Hotel,2012,67,"                      Even for a filmmaker who takes pride in scaling the fantastic down to everyday proportions, there's such a thing as going too slight.                  "
Walk Away Renee,2011,44,"                      ""Walk Away Renee"" lets us observe a mother-son bond, but Mr. Caouette hasn't found a way to galvanize this incarnation of material for strangers.                  "
Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry,2012,98,"                      Never Sorry doesn't aim to spur you into action by stoking your righteous indignation. Instead, it uses its charming, cool-kid rebel subject to make getting involved seem enticing.                  "
In the Family,2011,97,                      ...a humanist triumph.                  
Metro Manila,2013,94,"                      Metro Manila sports some excellent visual sequences, and manages to abstain from veering into overly soapy melodramatics... At its core, the film features a dynamite lead performance from Macapagal.                  "
Reality,2012,80,                      Explores the pratfalls of celebrity with the unashamed extravagance and reckless abandon of reality TV and its many characters.                  
Trash,2010,66,"                      Trash is a magical film, possessing the ability to simultaneously anger you and lift your spirits as you are taken for a thrilling ride through the injustice of life in Rio de Janeiro.                  "
Around the Block,2013,67,                      A gem of a film.                  
Remainder,2015,91,"                      Brilliantly written and directed, all that keeps Remainder from getting five stars is an ending that fails to provide satisfactory answers to the beautiful chaos that precedes it.                  "
Tomboy,2011,96,"                      As with her debut, Celine Sciamma has a knack for getting amazing performances out of her young actors. Particularly, Zoé Héran is a revelation. Her portrayal of a confused child (not of her sexuality but the sexual politics) is touching and deeply felt.                  "
Crawl,2011,63,"                      A sluggish, uninspired chore from start to finish.                  "
Agneepath,2012,92,"                      Agneepath's success is in Karan Malhotra's conscious decision to embrace the thing that makes Bollywood masala so appealing, the spectacle.                  "
Sisters,2015,60,"                      Sisters is one of those comedies that ends with a series of outtakes over the end credits, and by the looks of it, the talent had more fun shooting the film than we did watching it.                   "
Dracula 3D,2012,14,"                      Whether Mr. Argento meant this to be A) serious, B) silly, or C) a combination of both, the end result is, I'm sorry to say, almost completely unwatchable.                  "
Lucky,2011,15,"                      Drama cannot live on wobbly metaphors alone, and the untenable roles are played without charisma.                  "
Django Unchained,2012,87,"                      Quentin Tarantino continues to play with history and cinematic tradition in Django Unchained, his self-proclaimed “Southern” whose deposits of blaxploitation and Spaghetti Western filmmaking engage a violent saga of revenge and historical atrocity.                  "
Love Is All You Need,2012,75,"                      Love Is All You Need is a different strand of romantic comedy that has been missing for some time; sweet, heartwarming and utterly dysfunctional.                  "
"Turtle Hill, Brooklyn",2013,60,"                      A special film that exudes an honesty, authenticity and transparency that is rare even among the more transparent indie fare.                  "

Phantom Boy,2015,88,"                      Overall, Phantom Boy doesn't have the dense thematic complexity that many animated films have gone for since Pixar became the industry standard but it is a simply enjoyable alternative.                  "
Where Soldiers Come From,2011,82,"                      Its scope is both limited and intimate, a quality that is both to its credit and its detriment. But it is very much an essential document of the times we live in.                  "
Fatherhood,2021,67,                      Fatherhood is a heartbreakingly lovely comedy. It also has Kevin Hart’s very best performance.                  
The Sorcerer and the White Snake,2011,27,"                      Beautiful martial arts fantasy with scary imagery, violence.                  "
Allegiance,2012,29,                      Thoughtful characterizations and commendable performances only go so far when what's working as an intimate expos of the rank and file facing a gut-check moment of utilitarianism tries to become a taut thriller against the clock.                  
Alps,2011,75,                      Episode 21: Alps / Dogtooth / The Favourite - Yorgothon                  
17 Girls,2011,68,                      An altogether French film populated with fresh-faced and energetic young women...                  
Dirty Grandpa,2016,10,"                      The premise has potential, but the execution is painfully unfunny.                  "
Goddess,2013,35,"                      The music is catchy enough, but hampered by the lip-sync problems that persist throughout the dance sequences feel flat and uninventive.                  "
The Highwaymen,2019,58,"                      I get the inevitable complaints of “too slow” and “not enough action”. Yet I found myself loving it – the slow burn, the prickly Costner, the subtle moral questions it tosses out there.                  "
Turbo,2013,67,"                      The snail-eye view of burning up the racetrack at 200+ mph is thrilling; you'll think, 'Why am I getting this excited about an oxymoronic fast snail?' Finding one's bliss is magical!                  "
Deepwater Horizon,2016,82,"                      I’m an admitted disaster movie junkie, and many of them depend on some level of sensationalism. “Deepwater Horizon” keeps its focus on the 126 crew members aboard the rig on that horrible day.                   "
Semper Fi: Always Faithful,2011,100,                      Jerry Ensminger isn't an environmental or public health crusader as much as a grieving father.                  
Low Down,2014,50,"                      Jazz isn't just a style, it's a musical mood, and 'Low Down' gets right in there.                  "
The Tall Man,2011,85,"                      The Tall Man, a documentary from Australian director Tony Krawitz, paints a complex picture of the death in police custody of Aborigine Cameron Doomadgee, 36, on Palm Island (Queensland) in November 2004                  "
Confession of a Child of the Century,2012,0,"                      Sylvie Verheyde's Confessions of a Child of the Century will forever carry a certain curiosity with it thanks to its headlining star, but ultimately his performance is the detrimental stone which could plunge this adaptation into eventual obscurity.                  "
Detention of the Dead,2012,57,"                      Detention Of The Dead isn't the best zombie movie ever (or even this year) or the best teen movie ever, but we've all seen worse examples of both genres, and as combinations go, it serves as diversion for the audience.                  "
Silver Bullets,2011,78,"                      When lines get blurry, you need to maintain balance, and Silver Bullets has a solid center of gravity between multiple axes.                  "
Song of the Sea,2014,99,"                      Based on Irish folklore and soaked with mythic iconography, ""Song of the Sea"" confronts loss and sorrow head-on.                  "
The Sessions,2012,91,                      Lewin examines the potentially taboo subject of disabled people having intercourse in a matter-of-fact way that breaches the topic by rendering it a non-issue.                  
Three Kings,2011,94,"                      It has a distinctive look and feel, an atmosphere of burnout and chaos; it launches at a high energy level and generally stays there. The buzz, however, wears off fast.                  "
Broken,2012,63,"                      A first rating supporting cast is also responsible for some quietly observed moments, though none of the performers are able to mask the increasing hysterical elements of the film's overly dramatic narrative.                  "
Brothers Hypnotic,2013,100,"                      At 84 minutes, the doc feels a bit long, and it’s easy to envision a one-hour version working well for public broadcast. Still, Atlas does a fine job painting a complete picture of his subjects, and giving us a few musical treats along the way.                  "
Filly Brown,2012,42,"                      However much earnest commitment and passion that the cast lend to their roles, it ultimately cannot overcome the routine structure and approach to the overall execution.                  "
Hollow,2011,20,"                      Whilst Axelgaard as a director could be one to watch, in this instance he's regrettably hamstrung by the tired trappings of the found footage cycle, into which he is unable to breathe fresh air.                  "
The East,2013,76,                      That the film leaves us thinking about our morals yet has involved us in the entertaining intrigue of a spy drama is a testament to its effectiveness as a thriller and a project with something to say.                  
The Train,2011,94,                      Its waffly thoughts on cultural heritage can’t derail it.                  
This Changes Everything,2015,56,"                      A provocative, important argument, but this is ultimately a confused film, trying to fuse several different stories-some of which would have made interesting stand-alone documentaries-into one worthy, but uneasy whole.                  "
Marius,2013,50,"                      Slight in every conceivable aspect, it's the initial chapter in a continuing provincial trilogy of wayward love and strict adherence to social norms, here related without any kind of additional panache.                  "
The Judge,2014,49,"                      The familiarity of the story hurts what is Dobkin's otherwise pleasantly sincere and straightforward direction, and a number of fine performances.                  "
The Raid,2012,87,"                      The action is furious and non-stop, and Evans makes no bones about the type of movie he’s making. It’s heart-pounding and occasionally thrilling, but don’t expect much in terms of plot or character development.                  "
God Loves Uganda,2013,100,                      Williams' eye-opening doc reveals the truth about the origins of the Ugandan anti-gay movement and the army of American evangelicals who imported it.                  
Supporting Characters,2012,86,"                      Offers a few laughs, all served up on eyeball-gougingly ugly digital video.                  "
Into the White,2012,45,"                      Plods from one sequence to the next, unable to escape an inherent feeling of transparency, of wearing its simple themes on its humdrum sleeve.                  "
Hello Herman,2012,20,"                      It's a call to look at ourselves, our families, our schools, our workplaces, and our communities and doing everything that is within our power to do.                  "
Sparkle,2012,56,                      A film that should inspire instead collapses.                  
The Knot,2012,0,                      Truly dire wedding comedy The Knot represents an all-time low in Noel Clarke's distinctly patchy big-screen career.                  
X-Men: Days of Future Past,2014,90,"                      It’s start is a bit jarring, the future Sentinels look pretty generic, and I could list a few other nitpicks. But in terms of story, storytelling, and sheer entertainment, the movie scores where it counts.                  "
Excuse Me for Living,2012,14,"                      A catchy but irrelevant title is the first of many problems with Excuse Me for Living, which throws together a lot of superficially flashy elements that never gel in any organic way.                  "
The Darkness,2016,100,"                      It is a rather original take on several classic premises, but it might be a little too cryptic for its own good.                  "
Date and Switch,2014,30,"                      ""Date and Switch"" should have had something new to say about high school friendships. It doesn't.                  "
Kodachrome,2017,72,                      It’s equal parts family drama and character study with maybe a pinch of black comedy.                  
Maggie,2015,59,                      It is such an interesting mix of subtle horror and emotional family drama.                  
Zeroville,2019,23,                      Vikar is just a weird guy left out to dry on a plotline.                  
The British Guide to Showing Off,2011,93,"                      It never feels like a private party for the elite and well-connected, Benstock emphasising that it is an inclusive, non-judgemental space in which anyone can participate.                  "
Klitschko,2011,84,"                      It is a film both epic and intimate, a rousing tribute to two incredible athletes who, upon closer inspection, are actually so much more.                  "
Paris-Manhattan,2012,43,"                      Lellouche does herself no favours by wearing such influences on her sleeve, yet her cast are game, the locations look great, and the whole enterprise has an agreeably frothy touch.                  "
Under Control,2011,100,                      This documentary about nuclear power plants is as chilling as its title is ironic.                  
Corpo Celeste,2011,83,                      A good performance from newcomer Yile Vianello as Marta holds much of the film together.

From the Ashes,2011,100,"                      Wider themes of leadership and social class are explored, but it's fundamentally aimed at cricket fans, who'll doubtless relish rewatching Beefy's heroic feats with bat and ball.                  "
Pearl,2022,90,"                      When X came out it easily fell into the thriller sub-genre of horror movies building the suspense until the third act. Pearl, on the other had, was more of a drama that turned into a gory, slasher film.                  "
Black Box,2021,94,"                      For me, this is a fascinating look into a crash investigation and all of the hard work it entails. That we are also presented with a good mystery, too, is a big plus.                  "
Redemption,2013,48,"                      [The film is] incongruous, blending moral soul-searching with Statham’s usual martial arts-laden action.                  "
Kusama: Infinity,2018,94,"                      Unsung artists will likely benefit and be moved by her story the most, but anyone struggling to be recognized in a creative field will recognize her tale as well.                  "
One Way,2022,56,"                      Steeped in the rain-soaked, neon-bathed lore of ‘70’s American crime-noir thrillers; it is not too hard to envision a version of One Way with Walter Hill calling the shots and a cast boasting the likes of Bruce Dern and Warren Oates.                  "
Brimstone,2016,43,                      There's more than a whiff of sulphur about Brimstone.                  
Spotlight,2015,97,"                      There is an incredible balance within the film. It is a journalism procedural, but there is also the serious and unsettling story we witness being uncovered.                   "
Mitsuko Delivers,2011,43,                      Ishii has managed to create yet another female driven drama which successfully weaves gentle comedy with an underlying social message.                  
Comes a Bright Day,2012,38,"                      A cool, witty and very watchable British heist film.                  "
As Cool as I Am,2013,14,"                      The familiarity of the narrative - the movie does, after all, include such coming-of-age touchstones as first love and irresponsible parents - grows more and more problematic as time progresses...                  "
Affluenza,2014,20,"                      The generational conflict -- overly ambitious parents and their disaffected millennial children -- plays so on-the-nose it almost seems like satire, but it's really just bad writing.                  "
Orchestra of Exiles,2012,80,"                      It is a moving tale -- especially because so many of the people interviewed are descendants of the violinists, French horn players, pianists and others who escaped Nazi Germany and other countries of prewar Europe.                  "
Scenes of a Crime,2011,100,"                      If you watch ""Scenes of a Crime"" - and you very much should - be prepared to be outraged.                  "
Flight,2012,77,                      Washington delivers one of his most complex and intricate performances.                  
Blumenthal,2013,56,"                      Despite the uptight nature of the Blumenthals, ""Blumenthal"" feels far more relaxed, allowing their raw nerves to ease our own.                  "
Speak,2011,60,"                      Most of Speak is an uplifting portrait of friendly competition, and it's when the film embraces this narrative track, and the illumination of dream pursuit, that it really takes off.                  "
The Dinosaur Project,2012,29,"                      The weak central father/son relationship lacks much-needed bite and authenticity, whilst a badly-placed revenge-cum-horror story fails to register.                  "
Miss Bala,2011,87,"                      Hardwicke loads the barrel with everything any feminist action fan could hope for, but Miss Bala splatters shotgun-style, with fragments of narrative shrapnel piercing every scene, without hitting any specific dramatic targets.                  "
The Call,2013,44,                      There is just enough tension and just enough suspense to keep you invested. Unfortunately the eye-rolling ending almost undoes everything the film does right.                  
Vehicle 19,2013,23,"                      The degree to which Vehicle 19 flounders and ultimately fails is, to put it mildly, rather disappointing...                  "
God Bless America,2011,66,"                      God Bless America cries out for a change in a funny, shocking, unflinching manner and probes the depths of what it means to be a black comedy.                  "
Serenity,2011,82,"                      You don't need to be a fan, or have watched the show, or even like the genre to appreciate one of the best science-fiction movies of the 21st century.                  "
Nurse,2013,64,"                      Boasting a truly flabbergasting performance from Paz de la Huerta, Nurse 3D is the definition of modern camp. It's not ""good,"" but it's oh so good.                  "
Entrance,2012,80, 
Portrait of Wally,2012,90,"                      The case was finally resolved in 2010, as this fascinating documentary details. Don't expect an even-handed account of the case, though.                  "
The Last Supper,2012,62,                      Arsenic and old cliches...                  
Good Vibrations,2012,95,"                      Packed full of riotous heart and soul, there’s a sequence here that never fails to make me flood with happy tears.                  "
More Than the Rainbow,2012,80,"                      Lacks focus, and doesn't even recognize its own best material.                  "
Pompeii,2014,27,                      Its blunders are aplenty and it’s impossible to take anything the film does seriously.                  
Pusher,2012,47,                      What was edgy and exciting in the mid-1990s now fails to deliver the same buzz.                  
Trash,2014,66,"                      Trash is a magical film, possessing the ability to simultaneously anger you and lift your spirits as you are taken for a thrilling ride through the injustice of life in Rio de Janeiro.                  "
All These Small Moments,2018,83,"                      It is hard to believe that this is Melissa Miller Costanzo's directorial debut - what magic she stirs, even in the tumultuous, it feels like ""a worst fate to look away.""                  "
Arirang,2011,33,"                      Themes of depression, introspection and gradual resurfacing are universal; anybody who has ever struggled with their mental health could take something from Arirang.                  "
The Day He Arrives,2011,91,"                      For many this will be quite frustrating, but for those that it clicks for, much wealth can be wrought.                  "
Phantom,2013,25,                      A misfire of nearly offensive proportions.                  
On the Edge,2011,67,"                      The pieces are all exceptionally well-cast -- credit producer Jana Sue Memel and casting directors Mary Margiotta and Karen Margiotta -- and none outstays its welcome, which is the great advantage of short films.                  "
Tatsumi,2011,94,"                      Ultimately, it's disappointing that a film with so many positive elements falls so flat.                  "
The Look,2011,84,"                      A flawed but compelling documentary, Charlotte Rampling: The Look contemplates the fierce charms of this mystery-drenched icon.                  "
Sinister,2012,63,                      'Sinister' remains one of the most original horror movies out there.                   
The Best Offer,2013,56,                      The film is not without its share of flaws - the intentionally stilted dialogue will get on some folks' nerves - but does just enough to deliver upon expectations.                  
Trance,2013,69,                      Inside a twisting scenario about an art-heist-gone-wrong is Boyle’s more fascinating trip inside unconscious minds and damaged psyches.                  
Fire with Fire,2012,7,"                      So tedious that it's not even aware of its own tediousness. Richard Schiff is a minor highlight as a morally challenged defence attorney, but ultimately, can do nothing more than polish an unmentionable.                  "
The Protector 2,2013,17,"                      The story is still wildly juvenile, but the BMX assassins are back, along with the insanely destructive knee lunges and elbow strikes and lengthy martial arts face-offs.                  "
Electric Man,2012,20,"                      May be rough at best, but at least shows far more potential for future creative prosperity than many a micro budget effort.                  "
Great Speeches from a Dying World,2009,100,"                      Doesn't solve the issue of homelessness, but at least it captivates your heart by humanizing homeless people and by giving them a voice.                  "
Bad Ass,2012,20,                      ...rarely (if ever) manages to satisfactorily exploit its irresistible setup.                  
Dolphin Boy,2011,100,"                      This earnest but intimate film is the simple story of his recovery from post-traumatic stress disorder by swimming with dolphins. In a sense, it's also the portrait of a silent naif who finds his voice, confronts his demons, and comes of age.                  "
Heaven Is for Real,2014,51,                      2014 is proving to be the year that faith-based cinema is breaking out of its credible indie vibe and sweeping into wide release mode.                  
Estranged,2015,100,"                      Estranged offers an appealing blend of familiar and novel, repellent and elegant - forever playing with the idea that there is something foul and festering beneath the surface of this lovely home.                  "
Magic Magic,2013,68,"                      Its spell will stay with you, creepy crawling down your spine.                  "
People of a Feather,2011,86,"                      People of a Feather is best as a nature documentary, assembled from stunning footage of these fascinating creatures flying about the islands and diving into the Bay looking for food.                  "
The Big Wedding,2013,7,"                      With a story as imaginative as the title and ""jokes"" telegraphed so far in advance you need binoculars to see them coming, The Big Wedding is as appealing as a cash bar at the reception.                  "
Knife Fight,2012,28,"                      A fun, tack-sharp political drama with satirical underpinnings, buoyed by crisp characterizations.                  "
Dig,2022,17,                      The threadbare story is threadbare.                  
Very Good Girls,2013,19,                      Foner's screenplay gets seriously bogged down in the development of the romance between Fanning and the barely serviceable Boyd Holbrook.                  
What Maisie Knew,2012,87,                      The performance from newcomer Onata Aprile is astounding precisely because it's not astounding.                  
Delhi Belly,2011,89,"                      The film is a fun, dark, almost-screwball comedy, with a good balance of silly and witty.                  "
Yossi,2012,89,"                      Quiet and unassuming, Eytan Fox gives us a rather simple narrative about the ever changing difficulties of being gay.                  "
Under the Bed,2012,40,"                      Once, however, the monster comes out of its hiding place and sheds its psychosexual slough, all that remains is a silly, sub-Joe Dante clash between kids and creature, with a dénouement so bewilderingly arbitrary that disappointment is inevitable.                  "
Not Suitable for Children,2012,88,                      You'll laugh all the way to the sperm bank.                  
Mud,2012,97,                      The influence of Mark Twain lingers in the warm air of this present-day drama.                  
Overdrive,2017,29,"                      Overdrive is light fare, but fun stuff with amazing cars and chases ...                  "
Cupcakes,2013,78,                      ...a blockbuster slice of pop treacle...                  
The ABCs of Death,2012,37,"                      With each segment running at roughly five minutes in length, there's an inordinate amount of forgettable entries, but that's not to say it's not worth a look.                  "
Libertad,2021,100,                      Pure feminine adolescence of the highest caliber. [Full review in Spanish]                  
Black Mail,2022,14,"                      Black Mail really tries to put across Ray’s troubles as well, but that only makes the movie feel like a consumer awareness show written like an episode of Line of Duty.                   "
Chinese Puzzle,2013,79,                      ... Mediocre and digestible comedy. [Full review in Spanish]                  
Fairytale,2022,83,"                      Fairytale is not so much a phantasmagoria as a reality inevitably deformed by wear and tear, an impossible fiction that never fully starts, or that constantly restarts, because it no longer even finds its place in time.  [Full review in Spanish]                  "
Now Is Good,2012,56,"                      To be avoided at all costs, Now Is Good is in fact far from good, but instead a tiresome, often appalling drama with little or no honesty or tact.                  "
One Small Hitch,2013,17,                      One Small Hitch is just plain bad.                  
At Any Price,2012,51,"                      Very soapy, sorta dopey father-son drama.                  "
Pele,2021,82,"                      Pel seems to be an attempt to officially celebrate his life while he is here to talk about it. There wont be any shocking revelations for film fans, but it does explore the pressures of having a nations hopes at your feet.                   "
The Big Fix,2012,86,                      A convincing case is made that the government and the corporations it serves are worse than the mafia. A deeply radical film that makes you understand why young people risked pepper-spraying to build the Occupy Wall Street movement.                  
Just Do It: A Tale of Modern-day Outlaws,2011,77,                      Doesn't make for particularly scintillating viewing.                  
Indie Game: The Movie,2012,94,                      Everybody would benefit just from seeing how hard these guys work doing something they love to death. Their enthusiasm is awe-inspiring.

Begin Again,2013,83,"                      A variation of A Star is Born... But an optimist, kind, luminous and magical [take] led by a marvelous, sentimental humanist fable about second chances. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
UglyDolls,2019,28,"                      Ugly Dolls is a feel-good film which the under-10 kids might actually enjoy, unlike a Toy Story, which kids of all ages heartily embraced...                  "
Ford v Ferrari,2019,92,                      The best thing about Ford v Ferrari is how effective it is in injecting its adrenaline. Christian Bale is incredible in one of the movies with the most impressive sound design I've ever heard. [Full review in Spanish]                  
Let It Snow,2019,81,                      What a gift that for once queer women and non-binary people are invited to the holiday party.                  
Child of God,2013,42,                      There's a captivating performance and a queasy ambience to the film that at least makes it a sober sort of hillbilly horror.                  
Capital,2012,59,"                      The most recent film from Greek-born director Costa-Gavras, best known for Z (1969), State of Siege (1972) and Missing (1982), is Capital, a scathing assault on the world of financial speculation.                  "
The Immigrant,2013,85,                      James Gray’s story is engaging and heartbreaking. His characters are interesting and compelling.                  
The Look of Love,2013,54,"                      The Look of Love is deserving of a look, but don't be surprised if there aren't more than a few similarities between other tales told before.                  "
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,2015,70,"                      What comes as a shock is how the Hollywood adaptation has maintained many of the most controversial and un-commercial elements of the story, delivering a narrative with themes of terrorism, violence as entertainment, entertainment as propaganda.                  "
Borgman,2013,87,                      A strikingly composed parable of surprising humor and crafty wit.                  
Gangs of Wasseypur,2012,97,"                      It breathes with the ferocity and depth of a classic like The Godfather or Gangs of New York, but tells its own, very singular story. Darkly comic, brutal, and impactful, the film also features one of the greatest casts seen in a Hindi film.                  "
Ladies vs. Ricky Bahl,2011,67,                      Ladies vs Ricky Bahl proves that old adage: newness has a habit of wearing off.                  
The Good Son: The Life of Ray Boom Boom Mancini,2013,82,"                      The singular focus is not a fatal flaw. Not at all, really. It's merely a question haunting The Good Son even when its concentration steers the viewer away from it.                  "
Paul Williams Still Alive,2011,97,"                      In spite of its ramshackle, touch and go structure, Paul Williams Still Alive manages to paint a vivid picture of Mr. Williams by deconstructing his past and understanding his present with equal sensitivity.                  "
Sex Tape,2014,16,                      It's painful to watch so many talented people in such a bad movie                  
American Mary,2012,62,"                      The messaging gets a bit muddled in the second half, but American Mary offers plenty for viewers to chew on.                  "
Kiss of the Damned,2012,64,                      A deliciously vintage throwback to the erotic horror output of the Hammer studio heyday.                  
Noah,2014,75,                      It’s a movie that teases us with what it could have been but ultimately stumbles because of what it actually is.                  
Next Exit,2022,81,"                      An interesting conceit, and I sort of enjoyed it.                  "
American Assassin,2017,34,"                      It ends halfway between the most attractive ideas of the Bourne universe combined with all those eighties macho action movies and their ""one against all"" ideology that today defy any credibility. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
"Now, Forager",2012,55,"                      Despite its punning title, this is an earnest, absorbing drama set at the intersection of countercultural idealism and gastronomical sophistication.                  "
The Undefeated,2011,0,"                      ""Undefeated"" Palin did a fine job of making her fans feel like losers with this abortive trial balloon/infomercial. Losers and suckers.                  "
Tomorrowland,2015,50,                      A movie about ideas and inventions that has too much of both...                  
Boxing Day,2012,85,"                      It is a simple story told in a semi-experimental style which never really takes off, but neither does it detract from the performances in it and on that strength this film is very impressive indeed.                  "
In the House,2012,88,                      Kristin Scott Thomas may very well offer the film's most rewarding performance as she's both dramatically involving and often quite funny.                  
Hamlet,2011,0,"                      The result is a focused, if at times melodramatic, take on the play's beating heart.                  "
Hide Your Smiling Faces,2013,84,"                      For those who have deep and meaningful experiences with bereavement, it is difficult to fathom that this film won't be an absolutely remarkable view.                  "
Save the Date,2012,47,                      Caplan and Brie deserve a much better movie than this.                  
Father Figures,2017,17,                      It's difficult to ascertain what's harder to take in this laugh-free comedy: the sentimental bits or the expected dashes of witless crudity.                  
The Imposter,2012,95,"                      The Imposter is skilfully assembled film, as gripping as it is chilling and more memorable than most thrillers.                  "

Labor Day,2013,34,"                      The film doesn't round off a concise story, falling towards the end in the common places that tried so hard to avoid. [Full review in Spanish]                  "

Two Women,2014,89,"                      For most of us, it will be the presence of Ralph Fiennes that draws us to Two Women, and quite right too because he's very good in this adaptation of Ivan Turgenev's play A Month In The Country, even delivering his part in Russian.                  "

Il Futuro,2013,80,"                      While intriguing, and at moments, striking, there's an unfortunate distance from the events and characters in Scherson's film, and an undeniable indifference to what's unfolding before us.                  "
Tower Block,2012,47,"                      At very best, this cheap horror is a run-of-the-mill British exploitation flick with nothing new to say; at worst, it's classist, deeply conservative and completely narrow-minded.                  "

Hell Fest,2018,39,"                      The movie remains satisfying because it's not trying to approach the slasher genre from a place of irony or nostalgia, as many have in recent years.                  "
Breathe In,2013,57,"                      There's an enquiring restlessness to Doremus' camera, always searching for small gestures and glances which, along with Dustin O'Halloran's beautifully forlorn score and DoP John Guleserian washed-out palates, creates a sensuous, longing atmosphere.

Vesper,2022,89,"                      The movie creates an astounding world to look at, and it smartly doesn’t try to explain every strange detail.                  "
Mama,2013,63,"                      Following a common trend in supernatural horror, Mama begins with a novel premise and compelling characters, but then slowly digresses into bankrupt genre clichés, rampant exposition, and formulaic boo! moments.                  "
Sightseers,2012,86,"                      This dark comedy would be a devastatingly terrifying movie if it were not for the frequent moments of hilarity. As it stands, Sightseers is a pretty special and wholly effective mix of the two.                  "
The Unspeakable Act,2012,89,"                      Deadpan, naturalistic and non-judgemental.                  "
Go Down Death,2013,57,                      For those who enjoy a film where every little detail is not laid out in front of you and a lot is open to interpretation then Go Down Death may be the film for you                  
Identity Thief,2013,19,"                      If the plot is going to be light-hearted and fun-loving, there's simply no room for extremely dark characters and situations.                  "
The Broken Circle Breakdown,2012,83,                      The Broken Circle Breakdown never pulls punches when it comes to telling the complex realities of life that exist in the films story.                  
12 Years a Slave,2013,95,                      Piercing and heart-wrenching.                  
Medea,2012,86, 
Aftermath,2017,41,"                      If the drama evokes any emotion at all, it's frustration that, aside from McNairy's turn, the experience remains incapable of evoking any genuine emotion.                  "
Smiley,2012,17,"                      My personal hell would involve watching this movie on repeat. It is wretched, squandering a potentially iconic character with incompetent execution.                  "
Blue Caprice,2013,84,"                      “Blue Caprice” succeeds because of its great direction, two strong central performances, and an atmosphere and tone that does the story justice.                  "
Don Quixote,2010,43,"                      The film is an essay on Spain, and also an essay on Welles. Welles shared the Don's magniloquence, boundless self-esteem, ruinous generosity, romantic illusions and moral fervour.                  "
Freedom,2011,86,                      A convincing case is made that the government and the corporations it serves are worse than the mafia. A deeply radical film that makes you understand why young people risked pepper-spraying to build the Occupy Wall Street movement.                  
The Reluctant Fundamentalist,2012,57,"                      This drab political thriller is not unlike a relaunched brand of margarine. The creators obviously have the best of intentions, but cannot avoid the blandest of outcomes.                  "
USS Indianapolis: Men of Courage,2016,17,"                      We get to experience this incredible story, starring so many of our local folks and landmarks, on the big screen.                  "
Barrymore,2011,73,                      Think of it as one great performer saluting another.                  
Downloaded,2013,71,"                      Narrated entirely through personal testimony, we're given a rounded perspective of the case, both by the people that supported Napster and [those] that fought against it.                  "
Nana,2011,67,"                      Driven by a combination of narrative economy and emotional expansiveness, Valrie Massadian's ""Nana"" is as difficult to pin down as the inner life of the tiny human at its center.                  "
The Last Exorcism Part II,2013,15,                      The Last Exorcism 2 is another in 2013's long line of tepid horror.                  
The Great Wall,2016,35,"                      With a ponytail and dodgy accent, Damon fits awkwardly into the mix, putting in one of the most uneven performances of his career. The fact a Western actor is leading an Asian film should be uncomfortable, but in a film this bad, its hard to care.                  "
Starlet,2012,87,"                      Starlet is chilly, superficial and unpleasant.                  "
The Wedding Video,2012,67,"                      The comedy is never hearty enough to be truly enjoyable, only managing a chain reaction of titters at best.                  "
Flatliners,2017,4,"                      There's no sense in burying the lede: Flatliners is terrible. Instead of attempting a philosophical exploration of death and life, Flatliners settles for being a poor, generic thriller without any real thrills.                  "
Never Here,2017,80,"                      There may be some viewers willing to find meaning in the various puzzles Theron puts on screen, but the rest of us will be far too disinterested to care by the time the credits roll.                  "
Expecting,2013,23,                      There's a lot to be said for such an effortlessly graceful pairing when so little is usually said about such strong female friendships on the big screen.                  
Shirin in Love,2014,21,"                      Shirin isn't believable either as a product of her parents or as a romantic interest for either Mike or William, and since the movie can't sell those core relationships, it can't convince us of anything.                  "
The Pact,2012,66,"                      The Pact takes its time revealing anything specific about the horrors that hide in the family's house. For most of its running time, we don't have a good idea what Annie is up against, which makes the slow trickle of clues that much more tantalizing.                  "
Sweet Talk,2013,40,"                      Hopelessly stagebound, despite half-hearted efforts to open up what's basically a talky two-hander, and risibly pretentious in the manner of softcore porn that's no sexier than glossy ads for expensive perfume.                  "
Thunderstruck,2012,27,                      It's a family-friendly movie with a warmhearted message for children that -- surprisingly -- isn't too cheesy for their parents to enjoy as well.                  
Inside Llewyn Davis,2013,92,"                      While it may not be the best Coen brothers movie, it is undeniably theirs.                  "
Crazy Horse,2011,85,"                      As with nearly all of Wiseman's films, Crazy Horse is a narcotic, fly-on-the-wall immersion in the rhythms and predilections of a peculiar industry.                  "
Kingdom Come,2011,27,"                      This story about relatives who set about annoying each other at a funeral has some heartfelt emotion, but it clashes spectacularly with unseemly gross-out humor.                  "
Last Call at the Oasis,2011,81,"                      Yu's highly important film is a wake up call, and it does so with deafening facts and striking focus.                  "
Neil Young Journeys,2011,88,"                      Perhaps this is just the fan in me speaking but the problems with this movie are with the filmmaking, not with Neil Young.                  "
Night Moves,2013,86,"                      Shot by cinematographer Christopher Blauvelt with impressive clarity to the night scenes and weight to the mostly outdoor settings, Night Moves is an austere and beautifully composed film, marked by three excellent and nuanced performances at the center.                  "
The Last Gladiators,2011,90,"                      In a way, this doc is Bully, grown up, and from the bully's perspective.                  "
Kite,2014,0,"                      A compromised endeavor before it was even able to get off the ground, Kite never reaches the heights of its word-association based title.                  "
The Revolutionary,2012,83,                      An astounding performance by Sidney Rittenburg as he describes his loving and horrific 35 year relationship with Communist China.                  
Trash Dance,2012,100,"                      That Garrison has created such a vibrant, moving document of such an evanescent state of grace is a small miracle in itself.                  "
Alice in Wonderland,2010,51,                      For almost two hours we become prisoners in a land of menacing delight.  [Full review in Spanish]                   
The Happy Sad,2013,71,"                      Evans' film is one of the rare examples depicting people that exist in a recognizable environment, each struggling, as we all do, to achieve that tenuous idea we perceive to be happiness, and the sadness that must accompany in order to appreciate it.                  "
Home Run,2013,50,                      Home Run is likely the film that most people of faith who have ever struggled with substance abuse issues have been hoping would come around.                  
Side Effects,2013,81,"                      Soderbergh keeps the viewer involved and never sure what to expect, while every twist and turn comes as a surprise, informed and enhanced by the tricky film’s critique of the pharmacological industry.                  "
Photographic Memory,2011,94,"                      In the end, the camera in Photographic Memory is not so much roving as at ease with itself, moving at its own pace, not shambling but ambling along, content in its own small, personal, unassuming search for meaning.                  "
Eye in the Sky,2015,95,"                      Considers a much larger canvas than the warfare itself, from the politicians approving drone missions to the undercover agents on the ground scouting them.                   "
No,2012,93,                      An insightful look at the events that took place to vote out the dictatorship.                  
Manborg,2011,88,"                      Manborg's success in this regard has a lot to do with actor Matthew Kennedy, who plays the super cyborg with a kind of dorky pathos that's ripped straight out of a more innocent time in our pop culture history.                  "
Breakfast with Curtis,2012,78,                      A coming-of-age film that defies the trends and traps that have lately made that genre almost insufferable in American cinema.                  
The Road,2011,65,"                      If you can get past the shortcomings, The Road is a fun little horror movie that's best seen late at night with a group of friends.                  "
The Viral Factor,2012,56,"                      If action is all you seek, then I recommend that you watch the movie in 30-minute segments. Start, then stop when you get tired. Then, start again. It might be more palatable that way.                  "
Hello I Must Be Going,2012,75,"                      Returning to the comically tragic tone that made his much hailed 2002 debut, Love Liza so noteworthy, Louiso manages to create a memorable showcase for undervalued character actress Melanie Lynskey.                  "
The Forest for the Trees,2005,77,"                      Maren Ade's HFF thesis is proof that a powerful, worthwhile film can be made on zero budget when the director and actors are talented enough.                  "
A Band Called Death,2012,94,"                      This is a great doco for anyone who cares about rock and punk, and a brilliant primer on just how conservative, biased and cautious even the most seemingly rebellious of cultural movements can be.                  "
The Great Flood,2012,93,"                      Has a remarkably keen sense of time and place, and Morrison immerses us in a world that feels remarkably similar to our own, even through 87 years of film dirt and grain.                  "
Rocketman,2019,89,"                      A colorful exploration of John’s illustrious career, the film boldly addressed his many past addictions (with sex, drugs, and alcohol) while also functioning as an actual musical with huge setpieces and real-life singing...                  "
Any Day Now,2012,79,"                      ...as slight as the story is, Any Day Now proves that Matt Jay knows how to set a mood and it's one that should resonate with anyone who's ever felt uneasy in a new place.                  "
Greedy Lying Bastards,2012,68,                      There's something refreshing about a film that's willing to name names.                  
Delirium,2018,0,"                      If Delirium had been able to decide what it was going for and stuck with it, perhaps a passable film could have been pieced together. Sadly, what we are left with, instead, is a mixture with too many flavors to be any good.                  "
Shanghai Calling,2012,53,                      A star is born in Daniel Henney in the predictable film by Daniel Hsia...                  
Wonder Women! The Untold Story of American Superheroines,2012,100,"                      A brief, energetic, and powerful documentary; Wonder Women focused on the popular comic book character, but more broadly it focused on women in roles of action heroines.                  "
Dangerous Liaisons,2012,68,"                      For those familiar with the material, besides the language and location, there's absolutely nothing new brought to material that's been done better, several times before.                  "
Deranged,2012,60,                      virus thriller Deranged (Yeon-ga-si) tries hard to break free of its Contagion shackles by giving its infection a truly bizarre origin & symptomatology... [but] ends up being both preposterously silly and numbingly repetitive.                  
Open Grave,2013,22,"                      Conventional performances cannot inhibit this twisted, creative horror feature about a houseful of guests with no memories of their past.                  "
Sleepless,2017,25,"                      Director Baran Odar does well with this feature, and even gets an acceptable performance out of T.I.                  "
Fighting Fear,2011,50,"                      A documentary that reaffirms the hard-drinking, hard-partying, hard-fighting values of good old fashioned mateship, as Bra Boys director Macario De Souza follows the friendship of two friends - one a Big Wave Surfer and the other a cage-fighter.                  "
Harvest of Empire,2012,86,                      The stories grow more eye-opening as filmmakers Peter Getzels and Eduardo Lopez paint a recurring picture.                  
The Other Son,2012,79,"                      The Other Son, while it conceivably manages to warrant discussion, dances around the darker implications it barely hints at.                  "
Marina Abramovic: The Artist Is Present,2012,96,"                      This film is about how and why her fans and colleagues have fallen in love with her - and maybe just by understanding that, I too have fallen a little bit in love.                  "
Oscar,2011,12,"                      Despite all the running around, the movie still feels slow, dragging sluggishly toward the end of its long 109 minutes.                  "
The Suspect,2013,78,"                      An utterly ridiculous and over-the-top action movie from director Won Shin-yeon (Seven Days, A Bloody Aria), but at least it knows what it is...                  "
An Oversimplification of Her Beauty,2012,82,"                      A heady mix of fact and fiction, live action and animation, it's an enthralling collage that toys with the fluidity of narrative, experimenting with myriad emotions and ideas.                  "
The Invisible Front,2014,100,                      An absorbing new documentary that delves into the Lithuanian resistance against Soviet aggression and occupation circa 1944.                  
Lovesick,2011,40, 
Papirosen,2011,86,                      Papirosen transcends the home-movie genre by being ordinary; this is a look into the abyss that never strays from the surface of its chosen milieu.                  
The American Scream,2012,100,"                      Watching each family put together their haunted constructions, and talk about why they love doing it, and why they love Halloween is beautiful, inspiring, and just plain fun.                  "
Home,2011,30,"                      Home is certainly full of heart. Ultimately, however, it's also severely lacking the clear and concise voice needed to make this handsome depiction of one man's search for spiritual redemption anything other than a long-winded chore.                  "
My Way,2012,20,"                      In failing to capture the subtleties and ironies of British humour, Hallström falls just wide of the mark.                  "
Teacher of the Year,2014,100,"                      Strouse's strong suit is his casting. His writing and directing are solid, but his ability to select the right actor makes all the difference in ""Teacher of the Year"".                  "
Ethel,2012,89,"                      An attempt to tell one of the lesser-known stories of the Kennedy family, this documentary does its best to allow its subject, Ethel Kennedy, to give us an account of her life in her own words.                  "
My Brother the Devil,2012,90,"                      The prospect of yet another Hackney-hoodie crime drama hardly quickens the blood, yet writer-director Sally El Hosaini's contribution to the genre is more thoughtful and original than most.                  "
Blackbird,2012,57,                      This well-paced chase thriller stars Eric Bana and Olivia Wilde as sibling crooks on the run from a botched casino heist.                  
Sleepwalk with Me,2012,84,"                      Birbiglia is endlessly self-aware, but expresses no true awareness of the self.                  "
Bardo,2022,59,"                      The inside of Iñárritu's head isn't an especially fascinating place to spend two-and-a-half hours. There may be a handful of truths here, but not more, and the long stretches of tedium in between gradually take their toll.                  "
Blood,2012,55,"                      A little more foundation in front would be a good thing, but on the whole, it works.                  "
Musicwood,2012,100,                      A riveting tale of environmental crisis and industrial conflict with a commitment to depth and a musical cadence.                  
Sacrifice,2016,29,                      I felt like it was very obvious and it was very twisty and you kind of knew something was up from the start... it just ran too long towards the end.                  
Almost Perfect,2012,67,"                      The performances are the film's primary strength, particularly the casting of Hu in a nominally more serious dramatic role than her typical appearances, which she fills out nicely within the limitations of the script.                  "
Steve Jobs,2015,85,                      It is so satisfying to watch good actors work with a whip-smart script and under very assured direction.                  
The New World,2011,63,"                      Snow drifts bleed into slight white flowers dotting branches, ladders lead toward the empty vast sky, men eat men, men betray and war with one another, and love exists...                  "
High Ground,2012,100,                      Moving account of 11 disabled veterans on an expedition to climb Mount Lobuche in the Himalayas.                  
China Heavyweight,2012,82,"                      A thought-provoking work, a documentary with as much brain as it has brawn.                  "
The Best Man Holiday,2013,70,"                      You'll see everything coming a mile away, you'll feel manipulated but you'll also laugh and maybe even shed a tear.                  "
A Dark Truth,2012,8,"                      A lightweight flick about a heavy-duty subject, A Dark Truth plays like a TV movie back in the days when TV wasn't worth watching.                  "
Starry Starry Night,2011,58,                      The opulent visuals and special effects in Starry Starry Night are reason enough to take in this film.

Treading Water,2013,40,"                      Well-acted with a compelling concept, but shallow and less than the sum of its parts.                  "

Dead End,2019,100,                      This film is not designed to be a scary thriller. It's an homage to 1940's noir as well as the genteel murder mysteries for which Agatha Christie was known. The performances are pitch perfect for the genre...                  
El nino,2014,80,"                      Ample action scenes inject the chaos and thrill of the drug trade, but the film struggles to maintain a consistent tone and the jarring soundtrack ultimately kills any buzz.                  "

Mother of George,2013,91,"                      Dosunmu and editor Oriana Soddu are clearly fans of Young's work as well, since they choose to let each shot linger.

Welcome to Pine Hill,2012,86,"                      At turns meandering, imprecise, and even stilted, Miller manages to also have created a film and a character that's memorable, meditative, and moving.                  "
Dead Man Down,2013,41,"                      It’s on the strength of Farrell and Rapace, their supporting cast, and the visual confidence of the production that leaves Dead Man Down a worthwhile voyage into neo-noir territory.                  "

The Last Laugh,2016,98,                      Director Pearlstein makes it easy on us to decide by making the film both hilarious and thought-provoking.

Tammy,2014,24,                      Tammy is the slob comedy Alexander Payne is too dignified to write and direct.                  
Emperor,2012,32,                      Emperor is ultimately let down by the uninspiring plot and mostly weak performances.                  
Adore,2013,33,"                      Its Australian title, 'Adoration', sounds as flat on the tongue and unsure of itself as the actual film. Anne Fontaine never finds the right voice for her film's message and ends up with this disappointing, albeit handsomely made, effort.                  "
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,2014,91,                      The fact that “Dawn of The Planet of The Apes” is a summer tent-pole with a brain and a conscience shouldn’t be this refreshing...                  
Upside Down,2012,28,"                      One of the most original, creative and technically accomplished films of our time, Upside Down is a pure delight.                  "

Into the Storm,2014,21,                      At a brisk 89 minutes “Into the Storm” doesn’t exhaust its welcome. It aims for one rather uninspired target and for the most part it hits it.                  
The Hunt,2012,83,                      The Hunt is most fascinating when dissecting what happens to someone whose reputation has been destroyed.

Thale,2012,60,"                      There's none of the usual horror over-emphasis here - it's just observational, matter of fact, and thereby much creepier.                  "

Vishwaroopam,2013,100,"                      Vishwaroopam is proof, to me, that Kamal Haasan still has some juice, and he managed to exceed my modest expectations.                  "
Free Money,2022,100,"                      Healthily skeptical but not damning, and generally prioritizing human interest over political polemic, this gripping, broadly accessible breakdown of a globally resonant subject boasts few stylistic or rhetorical fireworks...                  "
Stray,2021,96,"                      Choosing to have the entire film centred around one particular dog, Lo opens herself up to a rather experimental form of documentary filmmaking.                   "
Troubadours,2011,64, 
99%: The Occupy Wall Street Collaborative Film,2013,67,"                      Compelling as a panorama with historical analysis at heart, rather than an intellectual deconstruction devoid of any visceral proof.                  "
A Teacher,2013,34,                      A Teacher is inconvenienced by an aggravating lack of character development.                  
Love,2012,40,"                      Sweet, funny and uplifting. Shu Qi sizzles.                  "
Down River,2013,100,"                      Ratner's script depicts each woman in distinct strokes, creating individual characters whose unique problems dovetail into one life lesson.                  "
Aline,2020,57,"                      Aline is a conundrum and a contradiction. More than any other recent biopic, Aline soldiers through all of the cliches and plot devices we’ve seen repeated ad nauseum. Yet, there’s a bizarre core that spins every scene on the axis.                  "
The Passenger,2022,73,"                      If you're a sci-fi fan desperate for a return to the heyday of make-up effects, you're going to love the hijinks The Passenger has in store for you.                  "
Aashiqui 2,2013,17,"                      ... lacklustre direction, amateurish writing, apathetic editing and unappealing acting.                  "
The Other Woman,2014,26,                      An annoying and inept mess of a movie.                  
Wildlike,2014,93,"                      Throw in two engaging performances from its leads‎ and it's a film worth talking about, especially considering how it's born out of a topic that so few do discuss.                  "
SOMM,2012,79,"                      Somm is the rare documentary that truly has you invested from the very beginning, takes you on an emotional roller coaster, and teaches you something about a topic you may otherwise never have learned.                  "
Addicted,2014,7,
Lawrence of Belgravia,2011,100,"                      Lovingly photographed with plenty close ups of graffiti sprayed walls, gig posters and vinyl covers, Kelly's film also captures London imaginatively.                  "
One Mile Away,2012,75,                      Woolcock's latest refuses to accept an oversimplification of the situation - and demands that the audience do the same.                  
Vanishing Waves,2012,70,"                      ""'Vanishing Waves' boasts a touch of Andrei Tarkovsky, but I found many similarities to the psychosexual thrillers of French director Alain Robbe-Grillet, most notably 'Eden and After' (1970) and 'Successive Slidings of Pleasure' (1974).""                  "
Before Midnight,2013,98,                      It uses many of the same familiar narrative structures of the previous films while also making a few pretty big departures.                  
Transcendence,2014,19,                      “Transcendence” looked good on paper but not in execution.                  
Backgammon,2015,0,                      The film's musings on artists and muses tries to be deep but gets bogged down in tiresome booze-soaked mind games.                  
The Bag Man,2014,11,                      The narrative is frustratingly repetitive.                  
Inequality for All,2013,90,"                      A subject that affects each of us on a daily basis, if you see only one documentary this year, make it Inequality For All.                  "
Reaching for the Moon,2013,67,                      A truly wonderful cinematic achievement.                  
Louder Than Bombs,2015,72,"                      There are occasionally some great scenes, but they never add up to much of anything.                  "
4 Minute Mile,2014,29,"                      A lazily derivative underdog sporting yarn, 4 Minute Mile treads tired ground.                  "
Newlyweeds,2013,71,"                      It's a tragic comedy in which the absurdity of the stoners' bad choices will find your funny bone. You will laugh and shake your head in mock disgust, because addicts are truly funny until they aren't anymore.                  "
Closed Circuit,2013,43,"                      In any event, artistically incomplete though it may be, Closed Circuit is a chilling, disturbing film.                  "
Crossroads,2013,15,                      A stinker from top to bottom...                  
Fill the Void,2012,89,"                      While Burshtein does offer up that sense of reverence and communal commitment, she doesn't idealize the community and isn't afraid to show the more business aspects of Purim.                  "
The Morning After,2006,63,                      A palpable misfire...                  
Bad 25,2012,92,                      A tribute to the master craftsman and musical talent that was Jackson and not a penetrative investigation of the man who made the music.                  
Sweetwater,2013,27,"                      It's not particularly congruent, but thanks to two terrific performances and director Logan Miller's determination to make his own kind of music, Sweetwater packs one hell of a punch.                  "
Home,2015,52,                      Home is an engaging animated adventure that will appeal far more to those under 8 than their accompanying adults.                  
Best Friends Forever,2013,50,"                      A hidden 2013 gem, and one that warrants a watch for fans of classic road trip films.                  "
The Jungle Book,2014,94,"                      While it has been years since I’ve seen the original, Favreau’s freshened up version pulls just as much from Rudyard Kipling’s 1894 stories as the animated feature.                  "
The Mountain Between Us,2017,39,"                      Winslet and Elba, of course, remain magnetic screen presences, though their dull character descriptions prevent anything beyond passing emotional investment.                   "
Symphony of the Soil,2012,63,                      Symphony of the Soil is a stellar example of a good idea with a bad execution.                  
Curse of Chucky,2013,75,"                      The attempts to tie everything up into a neat bow at the end feel jarring, abrupt, and rushed.                  "
Some Velvet Morning,2013,54,                      This dark and dismal psychological exercise features two winning performances in a film that warrants excited discussion after its closing frames.                  
Wild Card,2015,31,"                      Could have been an interesting look at the downside of Las Vegas life. Or it could have been a kick-butt action movie. As it is, it is neither.                  "
Rampage,2018,51,"                      The bulk of the problems with “Rampage” lie with the script. Four writers are credited (or to blame, depending on your perspective) with putting this hodgepodge together.                  "
Stuck,2012,60,                      Don't be off put by the hashtag in #STUCK. Writer/director Stuart Archer's film is less a glib comment on social media alienation and more a savvy reimagining of the romantic comedy.                  
Stay,2013,24,"                      While the performances are thoughtful, the execution and story is surprisingly trivial, never getting past the surface of the plot.                  "
The Internship,2013,35,"                      While the film never completely gels, it also never completely disappoints.                  "
The Love Punch,2013,29,                      The Love Punch harkens to the screwball antics of Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn in 'The Philadelphia Story.'                  
16 Acres,2012,100,"                      Explores the stew of hope, frustration, ambition, and PR spin-cycling involved in the decade-plus effort to rebuild.                  "
Sparks,2013,83,"                      With a well-delivered, intriguing story combined with multi-layered characters and a tone that makes Gotham City's gargoyles look like singing angels, Sparks is the superhero genre's dirty little secret.                  "
Andre Gregory: Before and After Dinner,2013,75,"                      Unfortunately, those unfamiliar with Gregory and his work will most likely find Kleine's documentary aggravating and without any type of thrust beyond a compilation of shared familial memories.                  "
The Sheik and I,2012,67,                      It's one thing to put a piece of yourself into your work; it's another thing when you become the work.                  
Mystery Road,2013,92,"                      An exploration of racial tensions through a radically placed protagonist, as well as a rousing finale, compensate for the lack of narrative oomph.                  "
Nightlight,2015,14,"                      I felt like it was an interesting idea, there were definitely times where I jumped, and it had a really cute dog in it named Kramer. There were just more parts that I didn't enjoy that outweigh the good.                  "
Koch,2012,90,"                      Like the city, Koch comes across here as brash, contradictory, almost endlessly fascinating and a bit sad.                  "
Skiptrace,2016,38,"                      For all the comforts nostalgia might bring to Skiptrace, the film's also a pretty good reminder that the Rush Hour era brought with it its fair share of cringeworthy shit.                  "
Electoral Dysfunction,2012,60,"                      An irreverent, civics-minded offering that's catnip for politicos and documentary film fans.                  "
Head Games,2012,88,                      The film struggles with the contradiction of knowing the serious risks while enjoying the games as participant and spectator.                  
The Narrow Road,2022,60,"                      We’ve seen this film countless times, just not in a pandemic setting.                  "
Money Monster,2016,59,"                      For a hostage thriller that wants its audience to ponder Wall Street's crimes, Money Monster's message feels muddled, and the film remains far too dismissible after it's over.                  "
Under the Rainbow,2013,64,                      French writer-director-actress Agnes Jaoui returns with a multi-generational cast who contemplate the chance of fairytale romances in Paris.                  
The Snow Queen,2012,0,"                      Overall I can't really recommend The Snow Queen to adults because I didn't really like it very much. That being said, I do not have kids but if I did they could do a lot worse then watch.                  "
Trouble Is My Business,2018,100,"                      This feels not so much like a noir as like an exercise in noir - cleverly constructed, respectfully realised, but lacking the kiss of life. In a sense, though, perhaps that is the point.                  "
Big Hero 6,2014,90,"                      It's enjoyable and, ultimately, harmless in an affectionate way that both younger audiences and their parents will appreciate.                  "
Supremacy,2014,33,"                      Supremacy rests on a premise that makes for high drama and surprise, though it’s not always executed. It’s the stuff of nightmarish fiction but the nonfiction source material adds a level of depth to its commentary on racism and race...                  "
The History of Future Folk,2012,93,"                      Not very good, but earns a lot of points for its earnestness, music and charm.                  "
The Source Family,2012,77,"                      It's hard not to be somewhat engrossed by Father Yod, even if the package presented is less enjoyable than it is textbook-designed, which is kind of funny given the bizarre and rebellious nature of the subject.                  "
Tricked: The Documentary,2013,38,"                      Although the behind-the-scenes process making up the first half of the film is illuminating, this would have been better served to remain a short narrative experiment from Verhoeven.                  "
Go for Sisters,2013,74,"                      Ross and Hamilton are captivating, and you'll come away from Go For Sisters in awe of them and thrilled because you'll have discovered a film that resoundingly fails to adhere to formula or stereotype.                  "
Departure,2015,87,"                      Beautifully shot in a stunning location, the characters' behaviour somehow make the place ugly, serving as a stark reminder that a place is only as beautiful as the people perceiving it.                  "
The Forgiven,2017,50,"                      Whitaker and Bana stand out in this somewhat staid, uneven and generally downbeat...South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission drama                  "
In Bloom,2013,90,"                      If a movie is going to be so rigid in crafting a realistic setting, it should have real movement to the story. Little here is invigorating.                  "
The Summit,2012,65,"                      It's a cautionary tale, where the slightest mistake could have tremendous consequences.                  "
The Divide,2015,92,                      The Divide actually says little that hasn't already been said.                  
American Milkshake,2013,0,                      The only lesson to be learned is that blissful ignorance is the overriding factor involved in appropriating useful characteristics of others for our gain and either being judgmental or dismissive of everything else.                  
Rush,2012,88,"                       Howard creates a persuasive sense of the time and place, and the race sequences are impressively mounted. This is thrillingly tense stuff, even if you know how the story panned out.                  "
Rufus,2012,33,"                      Rufus is well made as far as it goes, but it's hard to enjoy a story when you keep wondering when the Volturi are going to show up.                  "
Swandown,2012,100,"                      Fans of Kötting will surely lap this up, whilst newcomers to his oeuvre may just come away pleasantly surprised.                  "
Beyond the Hills,2012,91,"                      A slowly, quietly riveting passion play for a nation grappling with secularism and modernity.                  "
The World Before Her,2012,100,"                      Tradition and fashion, history and the future, politics and consumerism - these are the conflicts of this strong documentary.                  "
Wadjda,2012,99,                      Films like these are insightful and useful instruments for change.                  
Svengali,2013,38,                      Look through his 2D vision of the rock world and that's actually what makes Svengali a deeply touching experience...                  
The Book of Life,2014,83,"                      The Book of Life, like the best animated films, has its own tone, which helps it stand apart as its own thing. The music, a mix of original songs and fun takes on pop hits, is also worthy of praise.                  "
The Good Neighbor,2016,33,"                      What starts out as a cruel, yet carefully crafted prank, ends in a paranoid delusion with an emotional twist.                  "
Thirst,2011,100,"                      By focusing on [...] underground conspiracy, [director] Hardy and writer John Pinkney take Thirst away from the typical vampire movie [...]                  "
Spaceman,2016,0,"                      Unfortunately, Duhamel's bright performance ends up the highlight of the feature, which only provides a vague idea of Lee's life and love for belligerent behavior.                  "
Convenience,2013,80,                      This is a cheap and cheerful comic universe that feels no need for the delightful rules of credibility or narrative logic.                  
Blood Brother,2013,74,"                      The document of his devotion provides a window into a huge story, personalizing it enough so as not to be completely overwhelming.                  "
Drinking Buddies,2013,84,"                      Stripped of traditional glamor, Wilde is paradoxically incandescent. In the casual vestments of the Midwestern normie, she exudes that non-actor naturalism essential to this American subgenre.                  "
Persistence of Vision,2012,86,                      I swear I’ll never be able to look at Aladdin the same way again. The shade this documentary throws here is damning.                  
The Lifeguard,2013,16,"                      Though featuring a handful of winning performances from an extremely likeable cast, writer/director Liz W. Garcia's debut, The Lifeguard, is about as original and realistic as its metaphorical title is gauntly vague.                  "
Dive,2022,100,"                      The narrative shines in finding gestures and words that are recognized as harassment as time goes by, lending this testimony a different perspective from other stories. [Full review in Spanish]                   "
A Whisper to a Roar,2012,100,"                      A powerful documentary that ties together the heroic and ongoing efforts of democracy activists in five countries, and reaffirms the human spirit's innate desire for freedom.                  "
Magical Universe,2013,63,"                      ""Magical Universe"" is a tender portrait of the artist as a weirdly gifted, wildly prolific and strange man.                  "
Vulgaria,2012,57,"                      This scabrous behind-the-scenes commentary on the Hong Kong Category III sex comedy certainly lives up to its title - but amidst all the animal pussy-eating and candy-assisted cock-eating, there is also plenty of postmodern cake-eating.                  "
Kung Fu Panda 3,2016,86,"                      Overall, the animation arguably achieves the best looking of the three movies; however, Kung Fu Panda 3 is also the most inconsistently stylized.                   "
Gone Girl,2014,88,                      The visual presentation is moody and comfortless yet perfectly appropriate. And the music from Fincher favorites Atticus Ross and Trent Reznor creates atmospheres of tension.                  
Magic Mike XXL,2015,65,                      It's eye candy for the soul.                  
The Moment,2013,11,"                      Jennifer Jason Leigh stars in a committed performance, though she can't quite overcome the tedious fluctuations that drive us away rather than rope us in.                  "
Hellboy,2019,17,"                      The needless reboot of Hellboy sheds light on a union between director Neil Marshall and Lionsgate that practically screamed perfect match, but is in need of an annulment.                  "
The United States of Autism,2013,71,"                      A unique road trip documentary that, in attempting to throw a spotlight on the wide range of autistic spectrum disorder, broadens horizons in an invaluable way.                  "
Finding Dory,2016,94,"                      Finding Dory will stand as a solid, charming, and ceaselessly pleasant Pixar sequel.                  "
The Grand Budapest Hotel,2014,92,                      Wes Anderson blends his trademark fanciness with a more rompish style of humour than usual.                  
Love the Coopers,2015,18,                      I don't understand this movie.                  
Return to Nuke 'Em High Volume 1,2013,57,                      Return to Nuke 'Em High Volume 1 is an absurdly entertaining slapstick gore-fest that also manages to effectively pass along a timely message or two along the way.                  
Sweet Dreams,2012,90,"                      But the resulting film is scattershot, always skirting the surface, never digging deep enough, runnning through events as if it was a TV movie racing ahead to the next commercial break.                  "
Real,2013,57,"                      REAL is more a studio assignment than personal project for Kurosawa, yet it still displays the talents and obsessions that have made his name.                  "
"Doin' It in the Park: Pick-Up Basketball, NYC",2012,75,"                      Whether or not you play yourself, Doin' It in the Park is as involving as an afternoon on the court, and just about as much fun.                  "
Gregory Crewdson: Brief Encounters,2012,94,"                      Crewdson lays his process bare, allowing for unprecedented insight into why a visionary of his caliber shares what he sees with the rest of the world.                  "
Vanishing Pearls: The Oystermen of Pointe a la Hache,2014,100,                      The importance of a film like Vanishing Pearls is immeasurable.                  
Our Nixon,2013,91,"                      Rather than a typical by-the-numbers doc, it gives an unconventional slant on an endlessly intriguing figure.                  "
The Land of Hope,2012,50,"                      Unfortunately, it is impossible to separate the movie's tongue-in-cheek tone and its antics from the serious subject matter, resulting in a very inconsistent work.                  "
Men in Black: International,2019,23,                      You have to think this will mark the end of a franchise that (if we’re honest) probably shouldn’t have been resurrected to begin with.                  
Two,2021,43,"                      [Marina Gatell and Pablo Derqui's] bodies, their lines, their connection -at times uneven due to some not specially elaborated argumentative excuses- are the causes that keep the film standing. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
Blackbird,2020,63,                      Blackbird is the equivalent of running a story about euthanasia through an airbrushing app.                  
Crush,2022,76,"                      Crush doesn't do anything particularly revelatory to subvert its rom com tropes, but the easy going chemistry of the cast and queer WOC representation makes this an easy watch. Also: King Pun's art is delightful.                  "
The Standbys,2012,80,                      Enjoyable doc celebrates theater pros who rarely see the spotlight.                  
Masquerade,2012,100,"                      Even though Ha-sun is impersonating a King, it's the small changes he makes that cause the most dramatic impact.                  "
My Friend Dahmer,2017,86,"                      It's a frightening film, but more than that it's a drama. More than that it's a tragedy.                  "
Chakravyuh,2012,40,"                      [Chakravyuh] works intermittently in the first half, and not too well in the stretched second.                  "
Rubberneck,2012,62,"                      Alex Karpovsky's performance digs out the character's menacing, damaged and sympathetic qualities in equal measure.                  "
The Canyons,2013,21,"                      Flat and imbecilic, The Canyons is a chore in every sense                  "
Americons,2015,14,                      The subject matter could have been fascinating if the film weren't underwritten. Williams tries to build an entire movie around just a few key scenes and lots of filler.                  
Frozen,2013,90,"                      While trying to please everyone, Disney speaks to the lowest common denominator instead of setting itself apart.                  "
How Sweet It Is,2013,0,"                      How Sweet It Is may be sweet in spirit, but as a movie it isn't so, you know, sweet.                  "
Informant,2012,89,"                      This is a multilayered film that not only exposes a man's contradictions - a do-gooder narcissist; a thoughtful, delusional activist - but also speaks volumes about the fringes on both sides of the political spectrum.                  "
Last Dance,2012,60,"                      A well-meaning two-hander full of hot-button topics and charged with potential, the film is simply too polite and too timid to tackle the big questions it raises about race, religion, hatred and politics.                  "
Becoming Traviata,2012,81,                      Becoming Traviata gives a compelling and rare insight into the daily life of the opera industry from the perspective of a filmmaker.                  
Hunting Elephants,2013,36,"                      Levi, who made Lost Islands, a melodrama that was quite popular here a few years ago, is an accomplished showman and has made an entertaining comedy.                  "
Concussion,2013,75,"                      In less careful hands than director Stacie Passon's, the lineup of clients could have turned into a parade of clichés. But the camera, like Abby, meets each woman on her own terms.                  "
Come What May,2015,41,                      There's nothing more to it than meets the eye. Its lessons about cooperation and everyone fulfilling roles in the group according to their own strengths are high school essay basic.                  
Sherlock Gnomes,2018,27,"                      It's a serviceable animated take on a well known tale that also happens to be a sequel. One could call it a movie solely for kids, but you can't even trust them being happy with the product.                  "
Doomsday Book,2012,80,                      The philosophical message contained beneath each of these surreal shorts is shallow at best.                  
Friended to Death,2014,42,"                      ...a sly, yet extremely energetic wink at the dark side of our increasingly intrusive social media state of dependency...                  "
Love is in the Air,2013,65,"                      It's not so much that Love is in the Air is a terrible film, it's just terribly familiar and has the audacity to be every bit as predictable as you can surmise it will be from its opening frames.                  "
Pieta,2012,73,                      Perhaps the most disturbing thing about the imprecise but effective way Kang-do destroys human bodies is the frank simplicity with which Kim presents it.                  
Olympus Has Fallen,2013,50,                      Corny and overwrought.                  
The Zen of Bennett,2012,67,"                      It feels a bit like a classed-up infomercial at times, but it's still as much a treat to witness Bennett's process as it is to see him interact with today's young stars.                  "
The Selfish Giant,2013,98,                      Director Clio Barnard has delivered a movie that's excellently made but is in the end maybe a bit too suffocating to enjoy.                  
Flag Day,2021,40,"                      A drama with little dialogue, lots of music and too much screaming,  and bogged down by Penn's directorial toolbox... full of commonplace American indie clichés from the last three decades. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
Sherlock Holmes,2011,69,"                      Guy Ritchie brings his slick crime movie style to the old-school detective stories of Arthur Conan Doyle and turns the venerable detective into a strapping, scrapping action hero...                  "
Reasonable Doubt,2014,22,                      But bottom line -- there is no doubt about Reasonable Doubt -- it grabs your attention and holds on until the final verdict is in.                  
Wild,2014,88,                      Witherspoon's performance is outstanding.                  
We Are What We Are,2013,86,"                      Moody, tense, and delicately layered, when you boil it down to the bare essentials, this is still the story of an isolated, woodsy family eating folk.                  "
Double Trouble,2012,14,"                      A slickly packaged action comedy that, for both better and worse, gets much of its inspiration from Western sources. A lithe genre effort with a shrugging surface engagement that melts like a pat of butter.                  "
The Gallows,2015,14,                      It was just very slow and not many scares happened.                  
Eternity: the Movie,2014,0,"                      Thorpe means well, and the song parodies have a bizarre earnestness, but the comedy lacks variety and genuine wit.                  "
The Gatekeepers,2012,94,"                      Divided into seven segments, 'The Gatekeepers' does not stick to a chronological telling of history but instead hopscotches around to establish a throughline of morality, which is what director Dror Moreh seems to be most interested in.                  "
Afflicted,2013,83,"                      An entertaining genre film, presenting a handful of scenes to satisfy the gore mongers as well as those seeking a little substance.                  "
Small Time,2014,56,                      Regional filmmaking at its best.                  
Healing,2014,75,"                      The film's true star is the lyrical avian cinematography by Andrew Lesnie, of The Lord of the Rings renown.                  "
Summertime,2012,91,                      An intelligent and well-acted romantic drama.                  
Afternoon Delight,2013,66,"                      I want to see more movies like this, by more women, with more women. That would be delightful.                  "
Behaving Badly,2014,0,"                      ""Behaving Badly"" is a dreadful sex comedy that gets worse and worse as its dopey story snowballs into relative incoherence.                  "
A Werewolf Boy,2012,100,"                      In excellent subversive faction, it's the feral boy that really connects with the viewer on screen.                  "
Una,2016,76,"                      Lurches headlong into controversial territory, unflinchingly presenting a painful story that offers no easy answers.                  "
Galveston,2018,72,"                      It doesn't fail, but it doesn't succeed either.                  "
For Those in Peril,2013,88,"                      For Those in Peril is effective as an allegory, its haunting fairy tale continually drummed into our skulls as the film moves along.                  "
Hellaware,2013,94,"                      ""An additional 30 minutes would have benefitted 'Hellaware,' as Bilandic's characters unfortunately lack substance, much like his weak portrayal of rural America.""                  "
Enemy,2013,71,                      It will haunt the shit out of you                  
Blue Iguana,2018,38,"                      Oliver Daly’s film is a love letter to 80s action characters, but it’s just not a very good one.                  "
Beauty and the Beast,2014,41,"                      When Gans locks in on his leads, Beauty and the Beast soars like few other live-action fairy tale movies have in recent years.                  "
True Wolf,2012,20,"                      True Wolf is sophomore director Rob Whitehair's loving memorial to the now deceased animal, but unfortunately, it is a sequentially repetitive work of amateur semblance that tends to reminisce rather than inform.                  "
The Machine,2013,79,"                      The Machine is a highly enjoyable and brooding sci-fi flick in the philosophical vein of Blade Runner, with a smattering of other similarly minded or styled classics.                  "
Endless Love,2014,16,                      Far too serious to be a campy success and far too campy to ever take seriously.                  
Hell Baby,2013,33,                      Hell Baby does an amazing job by keeping the humor from digging too deep into slapstick but never really takes itself seriously.                   
MIS Human Secret Weapon,2012,71,"                      Filmmaker Junichi Suzuki reveals a WWII secret: 6,000 Japanese-Americans joined MIS (Military Intelligence Service, fighting against Japan, even 'tho the U.S. placed their loved ones into internment camps.                  "
Tower,2012,83,"                      As aggravatingly vague as it is interestingly observant, Radwanski has created a feature perhaps not wholly likeable, but, definitely unpredictable.                  "
Jannat 2,2012,0,"                      Jannat 2 is, for the most part, a badly-done, badly-acted enterprise, lifted only a notch by a couple of performances.                  "
Decoding Deepak,2012,55,                      Decoding Deepak is a loving film but also makes it clear that Deepak Chopra is enamored of the frenzy of his career.                  
The Reunion,2012,8,                      Pro wrestler John Cena stars in a WWE film about estranged half-brothers compelled to work together to rescue a kidnap victim in this old-TV-style family adventure-drama.                  
The Notebook,2013,67,"                      It's a strikingly photographed, pervasively bewitching account of adolescent twin boys and their development into (mostly) apathetic killing machines.                  "
Freezer,2014,33,"                      McDermott does his best to make Robert a fearless, wisecracking smart-ass in the early Bruce Willis mold, but he's defeated by a script so dopey that its best stab at a witticism is ""Baby, I wouldn't give you the ice off my eyebrows.""                  "
Almost Human,2013,45,"                      It's fun in the way that '80s horror was fun, particularly when it begins to let it rip with the gore effects, which it finally does during its bloody climax.                  "
Beneath,2013,31,                      It's all so stupefyingly disconnected from any actual human experience it almost maybe sort of spins back around on itself                  
In the Fog,2012,87,"                      In the Fog certainly demands your full attention throughout its two-hour runtime. Yet, for those willing to put in the legwork, the rewards are bountiful.                  "
Strangerland,2015,40,"                      Strangerland amounts to little more than a turgid 2 hours with a pair of bland, lifeless characters.                  "
A Belfast Story,2013,14,                      Boring beyond belief.                  
Switch,2011,33,"                      It's awful, but at least it is one of my favourite kinds of awful film: so awful it's a triumph.                  "
The Captive,2014,28,"                      An interesting enough premise, but in an effort to differentiate itself from a score of similarly themed police procedurals, it makes a few wrong turns.                  "
Dark Touch,2013,64,"                      Unfortunately, the film will have you recall Carrie more than it will draw you into its own narrative.                  "
Mary Queen of Scots,2018,62,"                      This is Ronan’s film and her performance is stellar. Far from being merely a villain or a rebel, her Mary is an independent woman full of life whose belief system is more aligned to women of today.                   "
It Felt Like Love,2013,84,"                      It Felt Like Love is Hittman's first credited feature, and when it begins to slow, one can tell that she is perhaps still navigating the transition from short to full-length.                  "
Hank and Asha,2013,65,"                      While many filmmakers have tackled the long-distance relationship storyline, few have gotten it done as satisfyingly as first-time filmmaker James E. Duff.                  "
The Conspiracy,2012,88,"                      There isn't much more here than a killer premise and a memorably creepy finale, but that is one beauty of the found-footage genre: These movies often don't need much more than that to be successful.                  "
Walk With Me,2017,81,"                      Narrated by Benedict Cumberbatch (his rich, mellifluous baritone is immediately recognizable)...a beautifully immersive documentary...                  "
"Like Father, Like Son",2013,87,"                      It seems Kore-eda Hirokazu is incapable of making bad movies. The babies-switched-at-birth premise in films is nothing new. But he just makes it so darn affecting and poignant, avoiding all the clichés that go with this kind of blurry-eyed family drama.                  "
Leviathan,2012,83,"                      The whole scene reminds me of late Godard films where he manipulates his video image into an abstraction. This is just the beginning of Lucien Castaing-Taylor and Véréna Paravel's jaw-dropping second feature, Leviathan.                  "
Blind Detective,2013,55,"                      The overstuffed plot and 2+ hour runtime make this one of To's minor works instead of a classic, but even second-tier To is a hell of an entertaining time.                  "
Deepsea Challenge,2014,67,"                      While watching Cameron get in touch with his inner Jacques Cousteau won't be to everyone's taste, fans of the director and oceanography gearheads should swoon to the immersive, visually spectacular images of the ocean floor.                  "
Noise,2022,100,"                      Although we are at all times searching for Julia's daughter, it's not always clear where we are or how we got there, which allows the film's momentum to flag repeatedly.                  "
The Shine of Day,2012,83,"                      Invites us to watch the birth of a warm familial bond between a grown man and his uncle, with all the pleasures, strains and negotiations that come with it.                  "
Playback,2012,0,"                      ambition alone can't make a good film, and if those elements are poorly put together and not fully realized, it can become less than the sum of its already tired parts                  "
7 Boxes,2012,97,"                      It's an action/thriller that makes you think and a sensitive, romantic film that makes feel deeply.                  "
Madame Bovary,2014,43,"                      It is Rhys Ifans playing the merchant of fancy goods that fuel Emma Bovary's relentless desires, who brings much needed energy and vitality to the movie.                  "
Snatched,2017,36,"                      As promising as a Schumer-Hawn team-up sounds, the two have little onscreen chemistry, comic or otherwise, and the occasional laughs are mostly from the supporting cast, leaving Snatched to feel like a missed opportunity.                  "
White House Down,2013,51,                      Never does White House Down surprise us or go in a direction we didn’t see coming. It’s all been manufactured to proven specifications and refuses to deviate from customary action movie schematics.                  
The Dirties,2013,81,"                      It's not perfect and not always successful, but The Dirties is an intricate, deliberate and relevant work that asks important questions and may just signal the arrival of a major new talent.                  "
PK,2014,78,"                      In the present atmosphere in India, it’s nothing short of bravery to openly discuss the failings of religion, and PK manages to do this in a highly entertaining fashion. This would not have been possible without the excellent cast headlined by Aamir...                  "
The Word,2013,0,                      A so-called thriller that fails at every turn.                  
Ape,2012,83,"                      Unfortunately, the film, particularly the first half, feels incredibly amateurish and sluggish, and creaks along like nails on the chalkboard until eventually finding a workable rhythm.                  "
Big Words,2013,100,"                      However, what's more impressive is how ""Big Words"" slips in major ideas about middle age, work, race, and gender politics into its narrative with ease.                  "
East Side Sushi,2014,95,                      East Side Sushi is a warm story about cultural identity and really good food.                  
The Last of the Unjust,2013,96,"                      The running time (like all Lanzmann's films) is not oppressive but allows for Murmelstein and his interlocutor to talk through, around and inside the context and reality of pragmatism, egoism, heroism and evil.                  "
The Well,2013,100,                      A film that cements Michael Rowe as on of the most important filmmakers in Mexico right now. [Full review in Spanish]                  
Sexy Baby,2012,70,"                      This raises more issues than it can possibly consider in depth, but the filmmakers' ambition is admirable, as is their refusal to draw simple conclusions about any of the subjects.                  "
Haunter,2013,53,"                      Never challenging or innovative, and consistent only in its fuzzy supernatural logic, the film is an empty exercise in atmosphere.                  "
The Mummy,2017,15,                      ...a generic middle-of-the-road movie.                   
The Road,2012,65,"                      If you can get past the shortcomings, The Road is a fun little horror movie that's best seen late at night with a group of friends.                  "
Pavilion,2012,100,"                      The lack of anything resembling a narrative at times makes Pavilion feel more like a demo-reel than a movie, but the fleeting moments Sutton has captured are so vibrant that they accumulate into something that hums.                  "
Grace Unplugged,2013,50,                      Predictable prodigal daughter tale with Christian message.

Wasteland,2013,60,"                      A derivative amalgamation of heist genre classics, all the while bearing an excessively smug grin.                  "
Bully,2012,85,"                      This isn't a Michael Moore style doc, with a glib host walking you through the issue at hand. Instead this is a fly-on-the-wall doc, cooly observing and reporting on its subject.                  "
Off Label,2012,50,"                      Off Label is a bleak, important wake-up call, giving voice to those that have been to hell and back.                  "
Barefoot,2014,17,                      Evan Rachel Wood gives Daisy a sort of Goldie Hawn meets Liza Minnelli that is comical and endearing even as a story unfolds that isn't even remotely believable.                  
Unmade in China,2012,63,                      Home-movie-like document of a disastrous film production offers a few laughs.

Bound by Flesh,2012,94,"                      The other aspect of Bound by Flesh that works so well is its compassionate portrait of two women who were, briefly, famous for their beauty despite their unconventional bodies.                  "
Jobs,2013,28,                      One has the distinct feeling that Jobs himself would have been particularly unimpressed with Jobs the movie.                  
Cold Turkey,2013,20,"                      [Writer-Director Will] Slocombe may not carve up his kin for Cold Turkey"" but he serves a wry repast.                  "
Bridegroom,2013,85,                      One of the year's most genuinely moving and thought-provoking documentary features.                  
David,2013,60,"                      David coasts on a few startlingly sharp scenes and zippy musical interludes, but doesn't add up to the sum of its zanier parts.                  "
Unfinished Business,2015,10,                      Tom Wilkinson is cast extremely against type for an immediately refreshing aspect.                  
Two Years at Sea,2011,87,"                      I wanted to know more about this Jake Williams (we only get to know his name at the end credits). There is no hint of loneliness in Williams' life. As the film's only inhabitant, Williams seems to be in complete ease at being alone.                  "
Linsanity,2013,65,"                      [It] remains an ingratiating glimpse at the mold-breaking player whose motto is ""God first, family second, basketball third.""                  "
Raanjhanaa,2013,70,                      Raanjhanaa harks back to an earlier era when stalking was considered legitimate courtship in Bollywood...                  
The Intern,2015,59,                      Meyers concocts a few madcap comedy situations to break up the otherwise low-key tone.                  
Haraamkhor,2015,67,"                      The final ten minutes resemble a sequence straight out of a modern-day Ramgopal Varma film - plain lazy, copout storytelling with an urgent burst of misplaced music drowning out the overall ambience.                  "
Expendable,2012,42,"                      Give us guns, violence, and babes and you might as well bottle it as male Kryptonite.                  "
Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster Returns,2013,100,                      Tigmanshu Dhulia - Saheb Biwi aur Gangster Returns' director and co-writer - proves yet again why he is one of the best talents of contemporary Bollywood.                  
Ragnarok,2013,69,"                      Sandemose certainly proves that fjords are strikingly cinematic, but he never fully capitalizes on the Ragnarok mythos or the Oseberg backstory.                  "
Trust Me,2014,52,"                      Trust Me flounders at the end, relying on contrived plot twists and exaggerated imagery to get its particular message across.                  "
In-Between Days,2012,86, 
Runner Runner,2013,7,"                      Though the film is over before it ever gets going, the good-looking cast doesn’t make the substance-free story worth enduring.                  "
Touchy Feely,2013,42,"                      A character study about fear of intimacy that makes up for the listless story with atmosphere and wonderful, naturalistic performances                  "
Everything or Nothing,2012,100,                      Serves as the perfect appetiser before the next adventure of Her Majesty's most loyal agent.                  
Stories We Tell,2012,94,"                      Surprisingly confessional and deeply compelling... The result is a story of great sadness, great joy and great entertainment.                  "
Made in America,2013,55,"                      ""I'm not a businessman - I'm a business, man,"" he once famously rapped. It's a line that should be kept in mind when watching this entertaining but disingenuous film.                  "
Lost River,2014,30,"                      Gosling seems preoccupied with the look of his film more than its substance. His vague ideas about moral and existential decomposition inhabit a cumbersome viewing experience that remains admirable at times, but never engaging.                  "
A Private War,2018,88,"                      Rosamund Pike is a master at her work, yet the film's structure does not help us connect with the crude reality of Marie Colvin's impressive persona. We become numb of emotion by the pace of it all. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
Assault on Wall Street,2013,25,"                      It's as subtle and as silly as you would expect, with an ending that's both a rally cry and request for a sequel.                  "
After the Battle,2012,27,                      The film requires a lot of perseverance to sit through and with very little pay off at the end                  
The Take,2016,47,"                      By all accounts, this by-the-numbers buddy-cop movie should have stayed hidden on the top shelf where it has been left for the past four years.                  "
Common People,2013,56,                      a celebration of England's green and pleasant public places                  
After Lucia,2012,86,"                      Difficult to watch if you were ever bullied at school, but with a dark, cathartic open ending...                  "
Gut Renovation,2012,30,"                      Rather than invoking sympathy or shared outrage, the filmmaker creates a kind of complicity with her audience, particularly as she explores the depressingly similar, sterile apartments of the high-rises steadily surrounding her.                  "
The Pirogue,2012,80,"                      The Pirogue compensates for its relative simplicity by a remarkable cast, honestly directed to reproduce a vast social tragedy, for which the Great Powers, the former colonial countries, are responsible.                  "
Mystery,2012,80,                      Lou's latest Mystery deservedly won three Asian Film awards last year including Best Film.                  
R... Rajkumar,2013,0,                      R.. Rajkumar is the worst film of the year. It has not one redeeming feature. Nothing. Zero.                  
Normal,2012,100,                      What saves it from TV-movie banality are the performances.                  
Pioneer,2013,55,                      It's an expertly manipulated film featuring some terrific underwater sequences and another intense performance from Aksel Hennie.                  
Space Station 76,2014,68,"                      More of a space age melodrama reflecting nostalgia for a bygone era of storytelling in its mixture of vintage and modern tone, it's as sweet, sad as it is often laugh out loud hysterical.                  "
Student,2012,67,"                      Omirbayev, who has made some interesting films in the past-Cardiogram, 1995; Killer, 1998-adopts the 19th century novel's ultimate religious moralizing as the guiding principle for his movie, to an artistically debilitating effect.                  "
Bounty Killer,2013,59,                      Bounty Killer quite literally is a live action representation of a comic book's cells that make us turn each page.                  
Crossfire Hurricane,2012,89,"                      As Crossfire Hurricane reminds us, the Stones were consciously designed to occupy a less reputable place in the pop zeitgeist... They embodied psychic danger, a Dionysian force flirting with all manner of uncontrollable sensuality and violence.                  "
Short Term 12,2013,98,                      A movie that doesn’t lose itself in the typical Hollywood contrivances and forced melodrama...

Harry Dean Stanton: Partly Fiction,2012,89,                      The problem with Partly Fiction is that the filmmakers were depending on Harry Dean Stanton's inherent coolness to carry the film.                  
Men at Lunch,2012,38,                      Relies too much on blarney and not enough on the rich history of New York and photography.                  
Fatal Assistance,2013,80,"                      We have been too blissful in our ignorance. Sure, it's tedious, but a clear conscience comes at a cost.                  "
Metalhead,2013,91,"                      By turns scathing, wounded, and contrite, the actress conveys an atonal, akimbo soulfulness that, yes, marks her as a true daughter of the Land of Bjrk.                  "
BFFs,2014,100,                      The camaraderie between the two leads is fun and playful and gives the film a lot of heart that I think indies have been missing lately.                  
Almost Married,2014,13,"                      Laughing with the film would probably promote the same kind of moral issues one would have watching a public execution for fun, but thankfully there's barely a joke that registers.                  "
The Forger,2014,9,                      The plot is a little lackluster -- the climactic heist isn't very climactic -- but director Philip Martin creates a strong sense of place and a strong sense of community among the characters.                  
Deliver Us from Evil,2014,29,                      Formulaic storytelling and glaring plot holes plague a film that tries to balance horror and cop procedural tropes into a half-hearted meditation on Christian faith.                  
Instructions Not Included,2013,57,"                      Instructions Not Included's humor, while effective, feels confused as to who it's aimed at. The physical gags are unapologetically slapstick and cartoony.                  "
Meet the Patels,2014,87,                      Cinema by way of the diary. ... confessions and discoveries unfold before the lens.                  
The Glass Castle,2017,51,"                      It’s depiction of the dark side of Janet Walls’ painful childhood is clear-eyed, visceral, and hard to watch. But it badly undersells a significant part of this profoundly penetrating true story.                   "

Bright Days Ahead,2013,88,"                      I think Bright Days Ahead will resonate with people who are nearing or in retirement, but people of all ages can appreciate it as a good film with a good story and strong acting.                  "
Viola,2012,92,                      Viola is an oddly mesmerizing film that gently asks to be taken in as more a mysterious theatrical poem than something of traditional narrative lineage.                  
Spectre,2015,63,"                      I liked the movie, and I’m anxious to give it another look. But with this cast and this pedigree I can’t help but be disappointed with what we get.                  "

Brooklyn,2015,97,"                      While the story is sweet and alluring and the film looks fantastic, this is mainly a sparkling showcase for Saoirse Ronan.                  "
Sundown,2016,9,"                      [Sundown] is a playful film with a strong cast and a bombastic soundtrack. It might not be the best Spring Break comedy ever, but this is a party you don't want to miss.                  "
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,2015,94,                      “Rogue Nation” ... embraces everything right about its predecessor and then elevates it.                  
Fed Up,2014,80,"                      Sadly, the benefits these families gained from being filmed for Fed Up - if there were any - seem lost as the film feels more exploitive more than revolutionary.                  "
The Rambler,2013,33,                      More proof that horror as a genre has been hedged out of midnight movie programming in favor of meandering strangeness.                  
Focus,2015,56,"                      Ultimately “Focus” is a movie stymied by its amoral vanity, its overload of mediocre twists and turns, and the lukewarm chemistry between Smith and Robbie.                  "
Merry Christmas,2013,14,                      Anna Condo's holiday trifle is the cinematic equivalent of a coal-stuffed stocking.                  
No Time to Die,2021,83,                      No Time to Die is an amalgam of all that has been the Craig Bond experience. The thrills are all still there and the action segments are among the best the franchise has offered.                  
Joe,2013,86,                      It is southern gothic to the core with an emphasis on the unpleasant and disturbing. It’s not a movie for the faint of heart. But it is an exciting return of sorts for Nicholas Cage...                  
Sunrise,2014,88,"                      Partho Sen-Gupta's Sunrise really is a technical marvel, one that paints images that are simultaneously surreal and picturesque, while capturing the debaucherous heart of Mumbai's back alleys in the most operatic manner.                  "
Modern Life Is Rubbish,2017,33,"                      Sadly, Gawthorne's script stumbles at the last hurdle...he caps the film with a twee artificial ending which doesn't deserve the sentiment it aims for.                  "
Malevolent,2018,58,                      Several smart decisions turns it into a surprisingly effective genre movie.                  
White Lies,2013,100,                      A solid feminine melodrama about the colonial/racist past of the director's adoptive country. [Full review in Spanish]                  
Haunt,2013,39,                      Chugs along until it finally arrives at a revelation that feels as predictable as it is unenthusiastically rendered.                  
The Institute,2012,71, 
The Battle of the Sexes,2013,89,                      Has much more to do with politics and personality than it does with hitting a ball over a net.                  
Dark Skies,2013,41,"                      While it's slow and features thinly-sketched characters, it's still capable of getting under your skin to unnerve you.                  "
Keeping Up with the Joneses,2016,19,                      A picture graced with four bright performances but hampered by a plot that felt recycled even back when Millard Fillmore was president.                  
The Liberator,2013,38,"                      Stylistically it's accomplished and Ramirez's performance comes close to redeeming the whole thing all on its own. But when we step away, we can see how the execution is all too familiar.                  "
Souvenir,2016,50,"                      Huppert proves the old adage that acting is reacting, and she can do wonderful things with a line like ""My father thinks you're great-and that bugs my mother.""                  "
1982,2013,78,"                      Oliver never backs away from difficult subject matter (semi-autobiographical, at that) and it's positively gut-wrenching to watch.                  "
Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle,2018,52,"                      Despite its impressive roster of voice performers and the appealing, weightier treatment of Rudyard Kipling's original characters, Serkis' film is a mass of aesthetic contradictions.                  "
Cheap Thrills,2013,88,                      caustic and cruel and somehow simultaneously super funny                  
Water,2012,91,                      WATER is a moving and important film that presents a horrific true story in beautiful images. The only downers are the somewhat too constructed dramaturgy and the sometimes missing closeness to the characters.                  
Enough Said,2013,95,                      One of the best romantic comedies in years.                  
The Unknown Known,2013,82,"                      The film may not be Morris's strongest film, but it's certainly a worthy edition to the pantheon of investigative oddities he's been building over the course of the last three decades.                  "
I Am Breathing,2013,92,                      [An] unforgettably moving documentary.                  
Reality,2014,80,                      Explores the pratfalls of celebrity with the unashamed extravagance and reckless abandon of reality TV and its many characters.                  
Scorched Earth,2018,18,                      Gina Carano wielding a crossbow in a low-budget DTV post-apocalyptic joint. That's all you need to know.                  
Flex Is Kings,2013,75,                      This would have been perfect as a half-hour short.                  
Gabriel,2014,84,"                      [Writer/Director Lou] Howe should be commended for taking on such a mature project that has its moments of intrigue, but Gabriel just never quite gets there.                  "
Home,2013,88,"                      The affecting and low-key drama skips past the usual dramatic scenes of someone who has suffered a psychotic breakdown, instead showing us the quieter but more convincing struggle of someone trying to piece his life back together afterwards.                  "
Howl,2015,63,                      All the characters were utterly annoying... the second thing was the cheese factor in this movie was very high.                  
Birth Story: Ina May Gaskin and The Farm Midwives,2012,88,"                      A Birth Story is far from universal...

Mothers and Daughters,2016,18,"                      It's a nice film, but most likely not to be remembered after it's opening day.                  "
Still Life,2013,63,"                      Ultimately, though, the stifling bleakness and an improbable ending add up to a disappointing film.                  "

Dead Sushi,2012,100,                      The presence of Noboru Iguchi as director is enough to make it a must-see or avoid - by the standards of Japanese splatter it's a entertaining 90 mins of unrestrained insanity                  
Mudbound,2017,97,                      It’s a difficult movie but an honest one that isn’t afraid to examine the stains of our past earnestly and without manipulation.                  
Moon Man,2012,86,"                      Sentimental it is not, just charming and quaintly unassuming.                  "
Pit Stop,2013,100,"                      A devastating portrait of queer loneliness, Pit Stop was an undeniable signal that great things would eventually come from this enterprising filmmaker.                  "
Les Invisibles,2012,100,                      A beautifully assembled film which pays close attention to nature and judiciously incorporates black and white photographs and home movie footage alongside its interviews.                  
The Invitation,2015,89,"                      The Invitation is best when it turns the cranks on an already uncomfortable social reunion, but the film doesn't shirk on the horrifying payoff either.                   "
Desperate Acts of Magic,2013,60,                      The film's real spark comes from Sascha Alexander as Ellen.

Trashed,2012,87,"                      Some arguments are a bit hamfisted, and Irons plays the serious journalist card a little too hard, but overall, Trashed is thought-provoking and illuminating.                  "
Richard Pryor: Omit the Logic,2013,86,"                      The movie is packed with articulate people who knew Pryor well, but the clips of the Man himself will leave you weeping for more.                  "
Rage,2014,12,"                      Painstakingly generic, one only wishes it would at least reach the heights of emotion its succinct title promises, yet every turn, and even a forlornly tacky plot twist, play out like some inevitable, flaccid Ferris Wheel of schlock.                  "
Cement Suitcase,2013,100,                      Cement Suitcase has just about everything you could want from an indie comedy.                  
Anomalisa,2015,91,"                      Examining ""Anomalisa"" for the romance and humanity is more arduous than liberating for what Kaufman is trying to say about inspiration.                  "
Dark Places,2015,23,                      The material plays like a common potboiler mystery with predictable twists and turns. That such weighty subject matter has been reduced to such banality is a tale of true crime itself.                  
Paris Countdown,2013,10,"                      Amusing as several moments are, Marie's got nothing particularly memorable in store for us with Paris Countdown.                  "
Seduced and Abandoned,2013,84,"                      Hugely self-indulgent and at times just plainly ridiculous, the most eye-opening aspect of Seduced and Abandoned is the very level of talent wrangled into contributing.                  "
Felony,2013,70,"                      Hardly the banal cop drama its oblique title would imply, Saville's film still lacks a certain finesse that would make this scenario have some sort of lasting impression.                  "
Aroused,2013,31,                      Aroused feels ultimately rushed and too slight for the expansive material and themes it sets out to tackle.                  
The Network,2013,67,                      Marginally insightful and incomplete while lacking in additional perspectives.

Lovesick,2014,29,                      Matt LeBlanc's likeability and comic timing fails to save this romantic comedy about a commitment-phobic teacher.                  
The Family,2013,28,"                      The Family mishandles almost every attempt at humor and tries to make a lovable, “Tony Soprano Lite” character out of Giovanni, except the paterfamilias is far too mean-spirited to win us over.                  "
Woman in Gold,2015,57,"                      Frankly, this is all too easy and too simple for Helen Mirren and company.  Despite attempts at provoking family and ancestral themes, the drama is rarely substantial enough to stir the audience.                   "
The Magnificent Seven,2016,64,"                      It’s an action romp, and Denzel and company pull it off nicely.                  "

Copperhead,2013,21,"                      Maxwell and Kauffman merit praise for acknowledging historical complexity, but the film's moral and aesthetic limitations keep Copperhead from entering this realm.                  "
Lucky Stiff,2014,40,"                      Talented Nikki M. James is the only possible reason to see this leadenly tongue-in-cheek, whimsical musical misfire.                  "

Deal,2012,3, 
Band of Sisters,2012,83,"                      Band of Sisters is an informative, engaging film that will change how you view these remarkable women, whose dedication to bettering their world comes as a logical extension of their religious beliefs.                  "
Elaine Stritch: Shoot Me,2013,99,"                      A delight in that we're able to spend time with as rare a creature as Elaine Stritch, but the film's human elements elevate it to greater heights.                  "
Atomic Blonde,2017,79,"                      Leitch’s film lacks zip, zilch, and zero in the style department.                   "
Ek Thi Daayan,2013,80,"                      [The] childhood part of the story has some of the most terrifying scenes, including a hide-and-seek sequence that racks up the tension, and a pretty well-done ritualistic black magic sequence it culminates in.                  "
Sample This,2012,93,                      Sample This is a jaw-dropping true story.

An Eye for Beauty,2014,20,"                      Unable to muster much in the way of tension, thanks to that napkin doodle of a plot and a pair of sublimely wooden lead performances, Arcand shoots for the moral complexity of Éric Rohmer and ends up with lesser Gabriele Muccino.                  "
The Rule,2014,60,"                      The school's track record is worthy of note, but the film often feels like a recruitment, orientation or fund-raising video.                  "
The Wolfpack,2015,86,"                      The material speaks volumes to those who spend their lives in darkened places before flickering images, but 'The Wolfpack' is an amateurish movie at best.                  "
Swim Little Fish Swim,2013,55,"                      I wouldn't be surprised to learn she was the one who the filmmakers most identified with since ""Swim Little Fish Swim"" is just as mischievous and natural, not to mention an unexpected treat as a result.                  "
36,2012,100,                      uses just 36 fixed shots - the same number as is found in a conventional photographic film roll - to tell the elliptical story of a snap-happy location scout's attempts to recover digital files and love (both lost).                  
Red Obsession,2013,86,                      Red Obsession captures the acute attention to detail any good documentary needs; high-definition shots of laborers harvesting the vineyards and actually turning the freshly picked grapes into a bottle of Bordeaux are fascinating processes to watch.                  
The World Made Straight,2015,64,"                      ""'The World Made Straight' is essentially a poor man's 'Out of the Furnace'... Still, it's a memorable spotlight for the always-mesmerizing Minka Kelly.""                  "
Trust Me,2013,52,"                      Trust Me flounders at the end, relying on contrived plot twists and exaggerated imagery to get its particular message across.                  "
Butterfly Girl,2014,100,"                      Bell's film captures the spectrum of emotions here: Abbie's desire for more as well as her fear, her parents' need to protect her as well as their wish to set her free.                  "
Gloria,2013,100,                      Gloria is magnetic and radiant... I left the theater feeling a little sad that a female lead like Garcia and a film like Gloria are both so rare.                  
Creep,2014,90,                      A deeply uncomfortable yet compelling viewing experience.                  
Hero,2012,94,"                      Through the film's striking use of color and landscape, combined with its riveting action sequences, it goes beyond the chronological constraints of a typical blockbuster film.                  "

Citadel,2012,56,"                      grim and bleak, piled high with moodiness, tension, and ominous atmosphere. It really is truly unsettling, and doesn't dissipate easily.                  "
For the Birds,2018,93,                      For the Birds often has trouble finding the balance between human interest and exploitation.                  
The Moo Man,2013,83,"                      Bachelier and Heathcote's The Moo Man may not initially seem like much by the standards of today's genre-defying documentaries, but it is an eloquent and considered portrait of rustic endeavour.                  "
The Duel,2016,26,"                      It's not entirely forgettable, yet in our current world where even big stars don't sell movie tickets, The Duel had to have something more in order to really be successful. The film is an unfortunate misfire.                  "
40 Days and Nights,2012,39,"                      Sure to be a hit with teens and 20-somethings, 40 Days and 40 Nights, while no great masterpiece, is nevertheless funny and worth the price of a bargain matinee.                  "
All the Light in the Sky,2012,80,"                      Instead of solidarity, the film offers solace..as aging deprives women of the potential to fulfill male (sexual) standards, it also frees them from having to try, and they can then begin to take life on its own terms, whatever happens..women may disagree.                  "
A River Changes Course,2013,91,"                      Rather than discussing the Khmer Rouge, Mam's film instead focuses on the little-seen world of the country's provincial population...                  "
The Boy,2015,68,                      So dark and so deep... really authentic.                  
Fuck for Forest,2012,63,"                      Documentary/fiction debate aside, Fuck for Forest still makes for an engaging viewing and provides an insight into the differences between cultures.                  "
Boy,2012,88,"                      As with all great comedy, there's some sadness and grit at its core that grounds the laughs in a relatable drama.                  "

Running from Crazy,2013,60,"                      Running From Crazy may not be the most hard hitting of Kopple's documentary endeavors, but she's brought an arresting subject to light from a family still entrenched in the evolving entertainment industry.                  "
Respect,2021,68,"                      Sadly, this particular example of a biopic does not find itself possessing an extraordinary execution to make it a singularly accomplished effort.                  "
Son of a Gun,2014,62,                      Filmmaker Julius Avery delivers an exceedingly erratic narrative that's at its best in a surprisingly captivating first half...                  
The Reckoning,2014,50,"                      The cop-shop scenes generate little vitality and the same goes for Green's working relationship with Viva Bianca, who does a lot of standing around in search of the right expression in the thankless role of his fellow detective.                  "
If I Were You,2012,13,"                      It's been a minute since we've seen [Marcia Gay Harden] in a really juicy lead role, and she sinks her teeth into this one. How unfortunate then that nothing else about the film even comes close to matching her considerable talents.                  "
Ninja: Shadow of a Tear,2013,100,"                      ""Ninja: Shadow of a Tear"" owns its pure, old-school aesthetic, and creates a modern B-movie classic.                  "

Bears,2014,89,"                      However well-intentioned and supportive of various wildlife preservation associations these productions may be, the G-Rated docs are more interested in producing awww responses from little kids than teaching them about nature.                  "

Left Behind,2014,0,                      …Left Behind seems entirely preoccupied with the mechanics of landing a jet aircraft on a motorway rather than any advanced theological questions...                  
Beyond the Edge,2013,69,                      Something of a laborious trek for anyone not enraptured by Everest or its collection of intrepid would-be conquerors.                  
This Is Where We Live,2013,88,"                      An admirably restrained, respectful portrait of the kinds of Americans contemporary films generally avoid showing at all--or if they do, treat with heavy-handed mawkishness.                  "
Oxyana,2013,80,                      The film is polished enough to open the door for discussion by political and movie-goers everywhere and emotional enough to warrant a reaction.                  
Among the Living,2014,80,"                      'Aux yeux des vivants' is fun and uncomfortable in equal levels, including its epilogue, as expected as attractive. [Full Review in Spanish]                  "
Before You Know It,2013,79,"                      What they say is something all of us should take to heart, regardless of that number we refer to as our age.                  "

West,2013,86,"                      Pregnant with deception and exuding a malignancy both frightening and perversely fascinating, cinematographer Frank Lamm's voyeuristic lensing beautifully conveys Nelly's heightened sense of paranoia.                  "
Pussy Riot - A Punk Prayer,2013,83,                      A rousing portrait of courage and re-silience.                  
Doc of the Dead,2014,91,"                      Although what we're given isn't anything new, and despite fizzling to a stop instead of going out with a bang, Doc of the Dead is still a fun trip down this particular road.                  "
"Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile",2019,55,"                      What Berlinger is after here, I think, is a collective portrait of a society taken in by Bundy — and, by extension, taken in by smiling evil that makes them feel good.                  "
"Stockholm, Pennsylvania",2015,27,"                      A provocative subject deserves a provocative platform. And while Stockholm, Pennsylvania is certainly provocative, it could stand to be a bit smarter.                  "
Babeldom,2012,86,"                      At its best, Babeldom recalls Chris Marker's La Jetée, Fritz Lang's Metropolis and Dziga Vertov's Man with a Movie Camera -- but like the modern city, is harsh, unyielding and emotionally distant.                  "
The Square,2013,100,                      A remarkable piece of documentary filmmaking that is both riveting and eye-opening.                  
Charlie Victor Romeo,2013,84,"                      ... the filmmakers do get at something really terrifying, particularly in their second scene -- the moment when small talk segues into a realization that one might not survive the day. Gimmicky 3D or not, that's no small feat.                  "
The Trials of Muhammad Ali,2013,88,"                      The Ali of this documentary entered the ring a phenom first, but came-of-age outside of it and grew into a man, second.                  "
Cooties,2014,46,                      It doesn’t commit enough to make the premise pop and ends up reaching for jokes and sinking into bad taste.                  
The Homestretch,2014,67,"                      The devastation of watching these kids is realizing how much they have to give. Their lives are as valuable as mine, or yours, yet due to circumstances, they are given little-to-zero agency over the outcome.                  "
May in the Summer,2013,58,"                      Plays as if it's quite undecided about whether it wants to be a socially aware comedy of cultural clashes or, unfortunately, a murky melodrama that pulls out all the subtle stops when it decides to stop spinning.                  "
Muscle Shoals,2013,97,"                      There is no doubt a variety of editorially rhythmic issues breakdown the musical flow of Muscle Shoals, but endure the touch and go structure and you'll find a wealth of rock 'n' roll history within.                  "
Last Knights,2015,16,"                      Kiriya's film moves through well-known paths, creating a nice movie that doesn't exaggerate in its digital effects nor treats the viewer like a fool. [Full Review in Spanish]                  "
Stretch,2014,88,                      ...briskly-paced and entirely ingratiating...                  
Aloft,2014,17,"                      The results are perplexing, and beautiful. Aloft is not easy to summarize, but it's even harder to forget.                  "
Ten,2014,22,"                      Part murder mystery, part cop actioner, and mishandled with a touch of Western justice, the film never finds even footing and stumbles throughout its messy presentation, which is punctuated by bloody violence and a pervasive macho attitude.                  "
The Crash Reel,2013,96,"                      The only problem is that, with so much fascinating material to cover, The Crash Reel skips over half of it.                  "
Point Blank,2019,40,"                      Whilst it follows the original film's narrative fairly closely, Lynch really makes Cavayé's source material his own thanks to his frenetic directing style and some really savvy script changes...                  "
Broken Horses,2015,25,"                      The performances are mediocre, with D'Onofrio coming across as comically theatrical. Yelchin as Jakey is comatose.                  "
Narco Cultura,2013,89,"                      Narco Cultura is not for the weak of stomach, but if you can get past all the blood and dead bodies, it is one of the most eye-opening and critically disturbing films of 2013.                  "
Wolf,2013,71,"                      There's an unmistakable authenticity to the Netherlands Taihuttu depicts, the cultural tensions between rich and poor, old and young and all the different ethnicities that only need to be illuminated slightly to become the stuff of high drama.                  "
Volando Bajo,2014,60,                      A great time at the movies. [Full review in Spanish]                  
Good Ol' Freda,2013,86,"                      Kelly's stories are often delightful. Combine that with tons of rare photos and great music from the Beatles and other bands of the era, and you have a breezy, amiable doc that leaves you with a smile on your face.                  "
Mademoiselle C,2013,47,                      Constant has resigned from constructing anything resembling a narrative arc with Mademoiselle C. It's so anecdotal that it feels like a music video highlight reel of the lives of fashion moguls.                  
Mr. Jones,2013,50,"                      It's creepy, it has great acting, a unique storyline, and it is the kind of film you can discuss with people long after it's over and still find new things to talk about.                  "
An Episode in the Life of an Iron Picker,2013,94,                      It goes to the director's credit that he has expertly told a universal story with strong local edge.                  
Frontera,2014,54,"                      I liked everything about this film, the writing by Michael Berry (who also directed the film) and Louis Moulinet, the pace, the editing, by Larry Madaras ('American Beauty') and the acting is excellent by the entire cast.                  "
Alien Abduction,2014,28,"                      Alien Abduction is a great movie. While it does have a lot going against it, you need to trust me on this one.                  "
Cold Comes the Night,2013,44,                      A generous throwback to those cinematic days when even familiar tales could be told with enough verve to initiate excitement and delight.                  
Springsteen and I,2013,89,                      Though the quality of many of the live clips is lacking - many are grainy or pixellated - the sheer power of the performance shines through.                  
Medora,2013,92,                      It's not just about basketball - it's about these young people attempting to carve out their own identities.

One Direction: This Is Us,2013,63,                      If your teen or 'tween is a fan you can certainly go far more wrong than taking them to this light yet reasonably entertaining band.                  
Redwood Highway,2013,80,"                      It is, among other things, a sharp distaff rejoinder to the male-centered, sour-faced ""Nebraska.""                  "
The Winding Stream,2014,100,"                      You'll not leave the theater without feeling that you, too, are part of the great flow of American music.                  "
The Other Side of the Ice,2013,50,"                      It is in these moments-contrasting human mutability with the awesome, almost absolute power of nature-that The Other Side of the Ice finds its true power...                  "
Alien Boy: The Life and Death of James Chasse,2013,100,"                      The film is a chilling, intimate look at one case of police brutality and the flawed justice system that allows officers to act with impunity.                  "
The Suicide Theory,2014,79,                      Director Dru Brown delves into a world of palpable violence tinged psychological terror and self-exploration with great aplomb.

A Girl Like Her,2015,65,"                      Well-intentioned but belabored, Weber's documentary conceit ultimately saps the story of its truthfulness and is therefore self-defeating.                  "
Rock the Casbah,2013,100,                      Heavily indebted to the collected works of Jane Austen...distinguishes itself via a purposeful sense of cultural specificity within a more broadly relatable story.                  
"A Fragile Trust: Plagiarism, Power, and Jayson Blair at the New York Times",2013,69,"                      By the end of the documentary, Grant has laid out all the pieces in an engaging, comprehensive way, neither absolving or sympathizing with Blair nor seeking to disregard the culpability of others...

All Cheerleaders Die,2013,49,"                      Though some might find the film to be tonally dissonant, there’s nothing queer women horror fans love more than a perfect mix of gore and tenderness.                  "
That Guy Dick Miller,2014,80,"                      That Guy Dick Miller is a great look at a man to whom any child of the '50s, '60s, '70s, or '80s owes more memories than we can probably count.                  "
Dirty Wars,2013,83,"                      Dirty Wars points to a series of terrible crimes, but rejects drawing any serious conclusions from them, leaving its audience suspended in mid-air.                  "
Arrival,2016,95,"                      I appreciated the intelligent science fiction, but also how the film steps beyond genre. It turned out to be far more intimate and thought-provoking than I ever expected. And all of that on top of the superb visuals, art direction, and score.                  "
The Harvest,2013,72,                      A decent story of betrayal only furnished in a teen oriented drama. [Full review in Spanish].                  
Life Inside Out,2013,67,"                      The film's two leads, Maggie Baird and Finneas O'Connell, are real life mother and son and that truth infuses the film with a heartfelt intimacy.                  "
Blackfish,2013,98,"                      It often gives definitive statements about ambiguous events, and it does try to frame opinions as facts. But it also gave me a greater appreciation for these incredible animals and it challenged my past apathy towards their plight.                  "
Citizen Koch,2013,54,"                      If you value civic equality and civil liberties, Citizen Koch is a must see.                  "
Home,2016,52,                      Home is an engaging animated adventure that will appeal far more to those under 8 than their accompanying adults.                  
Meru,2015,88,                      ...an intriguing structure that teases you to make negative assumptions before unveiling its deeper human component.                  
Poker Night,2014,50,"                      Poker Night has a lot to recommend it, but the game-night stories never seem to feed into Jeter's plight in a meaningful way.                  "
Google and the World Brain,2013,83,                      Clearly the editing wasn't finished... yet the passions captured over 24 months by Nezhat's cameras and a battalion of local chroniclers were undeniable.                  
The Machine Which Makes Everything Disappear,2012,67,"                      Not a happy depiction of the country of Georgia, but an honest, wholly engrossing one.                  "

One,2013,65,"                      One's stubborn resistance to dramatic artifice, its deliberate pacing and unexpressive-or rather, unemphatic-naturalism, leave it teetering on the brink of vapidity.                  "
Maidentrip,2013,83,"                      Regardless of the young sailor's considerable nautical expertise, there is no such thing as smooth sailing on the trip Dekker is going on and watching her navigate those waters is a beautiful and exciting sight to behold.                  "
The Source,2012,77,"                      It's hard not to be somewhat engrossed by Father Yod, even if the package presented is less enjoyable than it is textbook-designed, which is kind of funny given the bizarre and rebellious nature of the subject.                  "
The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,2015,65,                      The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is never a bad film. It's simply an unnecessary one.                  
Plastic,2014,14,                      The core foursome are also grossly underwritten and any injection of energy isn't sustained for long enough to raise the pulse.                  
No Men Beyond This Point,2015,50,"                      Anyone who tries to tackle gender is bound to get into a sticky situation of some sort, and for the most part No Men Beyond This Point is enjoyable despite its issues.                  "
Iceman,2014,20,"                      Hopefully, the second instalment of this two-parter film, slated for release later this year, has got the puerile humour out of its system to focus on only the action.                  "
A Million Ways to Die in the West,2014,33,"                      Almost nothing about the film works, and it leaves us wondering why anyone involved thought this was going to be funny.                  "

Alice Through the Looking Glass,2016,29,"                      The movie's overarching theme remains that time is short, and so we must make the most of it. But, thanks to this movie, time is a thief, stealing two unrecoverable hours from our lives.                   "
Going in Style,2017,47,                      The delicate balance between humor and pathos that informed the original has been replaced with broader gags and more blatantly manufactured sentiment.

Blackwood,2014,40,                      Blackwood's over-reliance on the sudden materialising of various apparitions to illicit jumps never quite works.                  
Israel: A Home Movie,2012,64,"                      From a purely aesthetic point of view, Israel: A Home Movie is a cinematic essay.                  "
White Reindeer,2013,90,"                      There are plenty of moments where White Reindeer could have easily veered off the rails into schmaltz or manipulative melodrama, but Clark avoids doing either, plucking all the right strings in this offbeat symphony.                  "

Utopia,2013,100,                      Utopia is a defining anti-colonial film which condemns Australians with as much fury as it does the endless system of bureaucracy which enables them.                  
Septic Man,2013,16,                      Ends up making The Human Centipede look like high art.

My Brother,2012,30,"                      Has no shortage of heart, but it has been so clumsily organized and falls back so often on clichd storytelling that any early goodwill quickly morphs into resentment.                  "
Valentine Road,2013,91,"                      Plumbs the pathetic depths of intolerance and distorted compassion in one of the supposedly most liberal states in the union.

The Stuart Hall Project,2013,100,"                      In the end, audiences not well versed in the intricacies of Hall's career, and even some who are, will be lost - but then found through the remarkable scenes and sounds of a lifetime of Hall speeches, television interviews, and thoughts.

Julia,2014,73,"                      The film keeps you on your toes as to where it is headed, breaking all the conventional cliché plotlines. And it's Swinton's finest hour since Deep End, as a conflicted, less than perfect small time crook finding her way.                  "
Sweet Virginia,2017,79,                      Takes place against a backdrop of duplicity and dread as Dagg maintains an air of menace that keeps things interesting.                  
Shut In,2016,5,"                      I'd say leave this to a film you pick on a night you want to stay in, and possibly fall asleep to.                  "
Sand Castle,2017,47,                      While the material isn't necessarily anything new - I thought the movie presented a slightly more interesting view of what when on there.                  
Flower,2017,50,                      What I immediately loved about Flower is that Winkler does not shy away from letting the audience know where he is taking his film from the opening moments.                   
Whiplash,2014,94,"                      Putting everything into your art or sport of choice has been the theme of many a dramatic motion picture, but few pour out their passions with such volatile intensity as Whiplash.                  "
Jojo Rabbit,2019,80,                      Much of the comedy is too broad to truly satirise the subject matter... unable to nail the emotional beats when it finally confronts the true reality and horror of the situation.                  
The Ardennes,2015,58,"                      Chilly and brooding, Pront and screenwriter Jeroen Perceval, make us wait for the third act before the film bares its nasty teeth, but proves to be well worth the anticipation.                  "
In the Courtyard,2014,71,"                      The dark heart of Dans la Cour makes its comedy ever more piquant, while Deneuve and Kervern are exceptional as two lonely souls finding solace in each other's company during the twilight years of their lives.                  "
The Outcasts,2017,56,                      The film has some gentle fun with high school archetypes without ever being mean-spirited.                  
Viral,2016,56,"                      I thought it was all right for what it was, I'm not a huge fan of this type of film. I'm not really a huge fan of like teen films either.                  "
Police Story: Lockdown,2013,25,"                      A reasonable action film from Mainland China, and one which should just about satisfy Jackie Chan fans, if not fulfil their dreams of seeing him return to his glory days                  "
Rough Cut,2013,20,"                      Though intriguing in its premise, Shovlin's bold cinematic experiment fails by being too portentous for its own good.                  "
Lenny Cooke,2013,78,                      ...suffers from an almost total lack of an entry point for viewers without any real interest in or enthusiasm for basketball...                  
Difret,2014,86,                      The awkwardness of the overall production evaporates whenever Getnet and Hagere deliver their haunting performances and it makes for a strong debut from a director with important stories to share.                  
Sisters,2013,85,"                      A nasty, brutal, terribly effective thriller.                  "
City of Gold,2015,90,"                      Regardless, it's a breezy delight, and the eye toward cultural exploration and open mindedness makes it hard to fault.                  "
Algorithms,2013,77,"                      Algorithms makes me wish I could play the game. More importantly, it demonstrates that, just like chess is about the mind, so is (dis)ability.                  "
Blind,2014,92,                      A riveting portrayal of human nature from first-time director Eskil Vogt...                  
Fire in the Night,2013,100,"                      There's a powerful insight into the different ways people face death, and how those who do not die come to terms with their good fortune.                  "
Leatherface,2017,27,"                      Manages to bring in the extremely unpleasant, unrelenting energy of the New French Extremity horror movement into the United States mostly intact.                  "
Jolly LLB,2013,67,"                      The ill-fitted nature of the film's limp comical jibes, and this odd finale, suggest Kapoor (and his producers) may have deliberately toned down the strong material for fear of retribution.                  "
Two Mothers,2013,33,"                      Its Australian title, 'Adoration', sounds as flat on the tongue and unsure of itself as the actual film. Anne Fontaine never finds the right voice for her film's message and ends up with this disappointing, albeit handsomely made, effort.                  "
Idiots,2012,100,                      Aamir Khan is stupendous as the rule-breaker Rancho. But the rest of the cast doesn't remain in the shadows.                  
Boulevard,2014,52,"                      With an adept supporting cast, this character driven story - which could easily have succumbed to its more clichéd elements - is helped along ably by Montiel's direction and avoidance of dramatic histrionics.                  "
New World,2013,63,                      There's the nagging feeling that there's nothing innately new and fresh about where [director Park Hoon-jung] takes the narrative.                  
Noble,2014,82,"                      [Stephen] Bradley's vision is clear, concise, and he has found that sweet spot between emotion, character, and visuals that come together perfectly.                  "
Closed Curtain,2013,91,"                      Still bold, still thoughtful, still witty, still confined, Panahi has made a film on the blessing and curse of creative vision.                  "
The Island of St. Matthews,2013,67,                      Is vivid portrayal of a small Mississippi town once ravaged by flood is swallowed up by an Art sandwich.                  
Baahubali: The Beginning,2015,90,                      Everything a blockbuster should be.                  
Uncle Howard,2016,92,"                      Uncle Howard carries us right back into Howard's fascinating world, living and making art in the 70s and 80s in New York                  "
The Retrieval,2013,93,"                      Chris Eska’s resonant, gem of a film, just his second feature, is a well-researched and relevant drama.                  "
Ted 2,2015,44,"                      Some may find the material serviceable, but Ted 2 further proves that sequels rarely ever stand up to their originals.                  "
Hot Tub Time Machine 2,2015,14,"                      Consistently funny, but it's something of a minor miracle that the movie doesn't fall apart at the seems.                  "
Match,2014,76,"                      When you have Patrick Stewart talking about his free-loving days back in the sixties, you're off to a positive start.                  "
September,2013,63,"                      It sounds like a wacky prime-time sitcom that would rule the boob tube for four years minimum. Instead, it's the scenario fueling Woody Allen's dreary drama.                  "
Ben-Hur,2016,25,"                      The decision to film the major set-pieces in extreme close-up was ill-advised, and these murky and incoherent bits are further crippled by obvious CGI as well as rapid-fire editing that recalls those Ginsu blades in action on late-night infomercials.                  "
Summer Camp,2015,56,"                      Summer Camp is the definition of unpredictability, bringing great laughs, hot bodies, spicy conversations, and maybe - viruses and death.                  "
LoveTrue,2016,78,                      It is hard to tell whether this film is overworked or just careless.                  
Greta,2018,61,                      “Greta” manages to deliver what most fans of the psychological thriller genre are looking for.                  
Love Is Strange,2014,93,"                      It's a pleasure to spend time with these characters, but be warned, their story packs an emotional wallop.                  "
Penumbra,2013,60,"                      There's talent here, but Villanueva, like a young artist still influenced by his elders, needs to find his own style or he'll become a skilled yet unexciting copyist.                  "
Stars in Shorts,2012,60,"                      It doesn't deliver a consistently enjoyable experience, because the quality of this compilation varies wildly.                  "
Midnight Special,2016,83,                      “Midnight Special” is such a satisfying experience from Nichols’ smart script and assured direction to the top-notch performances especially from Shannon.                  
La Maison de la radio,2013,62,"                      In both its strengths and flaws, ""La Maison de la radio"" reveals a lot about the modern media.                  "
Northwest,2013,91,                      It's a credit to the many non-actors employed by Noer that this Scandi-noir bubbles with a palpable tension always on the knife-edge of violence.                  
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: Sword of Destiny",2016,20,                      It's said Zhang Ziyi didn't want to come back for the sequel unless Ang Lee returned as well. We can see why.                  
Tomorrow,2018,29,"                      Quite an achievement for the team to have Martin Scorsese on board as one of 10 (!) executive producers, but, sadly, the movie is so poor across the board, it has scant claims on our attention.                  "
Austin Found,2017,21,"                      There's some sharp satire early on, but the criminal partnership between the mother and boyfriend strains credulity and the movie lacks the gravitas required for its late detour into emotionally ugly drama.                  "
LFO,2013,100,"                      LFO shows that an innovative science fiction film does not need an enormous budget, it just needs to be willing to ask ""What if?""                  "
Star Trek Beyond,2016,86,                      “Beyond” is a fun and satisfying installment that fits nicely within the new franchise vision.                   
Rosie,2013,67, 
Echo,2013,50,"                      From start to finish, Earth to Echo wants to jog our memories about the unforgettable experiences we have experienced with our best friends.                  "
Miss Julie,2014,52,"                      There are many things worth commending, one of which is the strength of the performances. But as I step back and think about it as an overall piece, I find myself overwhelmingly ... unaffected.                  "
Bambi,2013,91,"                      Disney starts to reach for a higher thesis but ultimately falls short, they will eventually find the nuance they clearly were looking for here in future films, but sadly Bambi just starts to scratch the surface of what they were ultimately looking for.                  "
Time Lapse,2014,78,"                      a clever, low-budget genre flick with more ideas than money.                  "
You and Me,2011,86,"                      Under Lang's direction, all performances measure up, with the character folk, headed by Harey Cairey. taking top honors.                  "
I Wish,2012,94,                      My favorite part of the film is the static shots of inanimate objects near the end: mementos from their journey. The shots are held just long enough for us to appreciate those shared eternal moments.                  
Fences,2016,92,"                      “Fences” is lively and vibrant yet aching and tragic. The cast’s rapport carries over beautifully from stage to screen, and their handling of August Wilson’s characters comes from an understanding far deeper that simple familiarity.                  "
Keep on Keepin' On,2014,98,"                      Keep on Keepin’ On is a poignant if slow meditation on music, life, and legacy.                  "
Approaching the Unknown,2016,43,                      Painfully dull and boring movie. This science fiction movie does everything but serve as a relevant take on the genre. [Full review in Spanish].                  
Churchill,2017,49,"                      Churchill creates, as did the man himself in his lifetime, the illusion of stability, even at the height of crisis. This alone is worth the price of admission.                  "
In Order of Disappearance,2014,86,                      A delirious climax pays homage to '90s thrillers and will leave you with an incredulous smile on your face.                  
Vishwaroopam 2,2018,0,"                      The problem with globe-trotting espionage dramas is rooted into its form. Spy thrillers have very little to draw upon, which is why we see so many of the modern versions parodying their own themes rather than building upon real experiences.                  "
Hey Bartender,2013,65,"                      An entertaining look into a profession that may not be taken seriously outside its own circles. It's briskly paced, and provides nice insight into some of the more interesting characters.                  "
Hitman: Agent 47,2015,8,"                      The action definitely has more fire than the story or its characters, but that’s a pretty low bar.                  "
Big Sky,2015,18,                      The plot is entirely too underdeveloped and all the characters suffer from its neglect. A hard movie to sit through.                  
Broadway Idiot,2013,62,"                      Feeling like a making-of featurette that somehow got stretched out to 80 minutes, Broadway Idiot has moments that are truly compelling, but they're few and far between, and the filler will be pretty boring to anyone who isn't already a fan...                  "
The Chaperone,2018,47,"                      All the corny romance stuff is about as intrinsic to the film’s soft appeal as the scrupulously well-made frocks, encompassing late Edwardian lace and flapper-style dropwaist numbers, and dozens of well-turned cloche hats.                  "
Young Ones,2014,47,"                      It's ""Mad Max"" with less accents, hipster/vintage fashion instead of embarrassing rejects from an S&M catalog, and, regrettably, fewer gallons of movie-compelling fuel to push any envelopes.                  "
The Debt,2015,44,"                      With a tortured structure, uneven pacing, and the specter of the oft-reviled ""white savior,"" The Debt's narrative never rises to the level of its thesis about economic exploitation.                  "
The Two Escobars,2010,85,"                      A chilling cautionary tale about what can happen when success becomes a drug ... once you're hooked, the only thing that matters is maintaining the high at any cost.                  "
The Boss,2016,22,                      Provides big laughs throughout.                  
The Secret Garden,2020,67,"                      I did very much appreciate the film's depiction of the garden, with elements of crumbling old castle, and CGI that allows the filmmakers to amp the charm and mystery up to 100.                  "
All You Need Is Love,2014,20,                      The film never quite seems more than merely a PSA about a troubled region harboring a populous in need of significant assistance.                  
Above and Beyond,2014,85,                      This is a flat-out terrific film that is not ashamed to celebrate heroism and derring-do attitude.                  
Game Night,2018,85,                      Plemons steals every scene he is in. I also can’t say enough about the comic timing of both Bateman and McAdams. Both work at just the right pitch and hold everything together even as things begin to unravel in the third act.                  
Lily,2013,100,"                      Its examinations, while not brazenly profound, are innately moving and compelling, and the film features a subtle, beautifully rendered lead performance.                  "
Submission,2017,51,"                      Submission keeps the audience engaged with a slight but well-told story, it just might leave you wanting a little bit more. It’s still a respectable film on its own but rarely digs deep enough into this complex issue to have anything surprising to say.                  "
Life of a King,2013,43,                      All in all this is a good movie.                  
The Grinch,2018,59,"                      Its a fun, harmless venture back to Whoville and serves as a solid seasonal bridge for those already ready to deck the halls.                  "
The Secret Life of Pets,2016,72,                      Alexandre Desplat’s snazzy score amazingly keeps up and sometimes directs the film’s shifting tones.                  
American Made Movie,2013,40,"                      Mildly engaging for armchair politicos, but generally more successful as only a diagnostic statement of basic socioeconomic condition than a groundbreaking work in and of itself.                  "
Sea Fever,2019,87,"                      A film that warns about the ecological impact of humankind, as well as how little we truly know about the ocean and what lies in its depths, Sea Fever is a sci-fi thriller that's about more than just what lies on the surface.                  "
Tenderness,2013,40,"                      Based on less ambiguous YA novel , the teens drive film and portrayals of damaged youth are tense and sympathetic, though their behavior veers too sharply to pathological.                  "
Blackhat,2015,33,"                      ""Blackhat"" is a movie built around a good idea and strengthened by some fantastic pulse-pounding action. But ultimately it sinks due to its tiresome, long-winded story. Even the ever likable Chris Hemsworth can't help it.                  "
Ida,2013,96,                      “Ida” is a movie about self-discovery. It’s about a young girl finding her identity and dealing with the revelations of who she is and where she comes from.                  
Cyrano de Bergerac,2012,100,                      The result is a nosier Depardieu without loosing sex appeal.  [Full review in Spanish]                   
Everest,2015,73,"                      A hard watch...however, these emotions are heightened by the excellent work of actors and cinematography, who make the mammoth, deadly mountain and its treacherous conditions come to life through the screen.                  "
American Jesus,2013,63,"                      One of the best, if not, the best documentary on Christianity in the United States today, lift your arms in prayer and say ""Hallelujah"" for Americam Jesus.                  "
One Third,2014,43,                      A valuable examination of the intersection of Eastern and Western philosophies from a distinctly Asian perspective.                  
Imminent Threat,2015,80,"                      …compelling evidence that while war should always be the last option that a civilised world will consider, the gradual erosion of our civil liberties is just as chilling and signifigant a threat..                  "
The Kill Team,2013,91,"                      The Kill Team makes clear that the unit was not some rogue outfit, but conducting itself according to the US military's standard operating procedures.                  "
Return,2013,83,"                      Whilst admittedly showcasing a powerhouse performance by Cardellini, Return sadly fails to convey its heart-rending story                  "
Endless Night,2015,8,                      There are too few instances where all of the film's different elements come together to deliver any kind of visceral charge.

Absence,2013,22,"                      Absence has its moments, but in its determination not to be sensationalistic, it winds up often being far too low-key for its own good.                  "
"Two Days, One Night",2014,97,"                      The film goes from the social to the intimate, without judging anyone, without dividing the world between villains and heroes... [Full review in Spanish]                  "
Bird Box,2018,64,                      “Bird Box” runs the gambit from riveting to predictable to kinda silly. At the same time it’s never boring and the performances are always worth watching.

Winter Sleep,2014,87,"                      There is great density within the richly spoken dialogue that endlessly flows throughout the film, but it's almost as if the ideas that flourish through spoken thoughts end up nearing drowning the purely cinematic aspects of the film.                  "

The End of the World,2013,83,"                      Much of the movie goes by with almost nothing of significance happening beyond these actors goofing around together, and this is enjoyable until the formulaic plot takes over, and we lose interest.                  "
Beauty and the Beast,2017,71,"                      Rather than going back to the original fairy tale by Mme. Leprince de Beaumont and reenvisioning it, the film reformats the studios cherished animated original with actors and computer-animated special FX.

Bombay Talkies,2013,78,                      Bombay Talkies is a unique experiment that works very well. The collaboration between four leading directors suggests a confidence that was rare in the industry even a decade ago. I believe that things can only get better from here on.

Home Sweet Hell,2015,5,"                      In the end, Home Sweet Hell is neither an adequate black comedy nor a good slasher film. It's just hellish. There's nothing sweet about it.                  "
Kingsman: The Secret Service,2014,75,"                      Vaughn has proven himself an expert at adapting stories of such ilk, and here's another one—a film that seems to belong on the comic's page, but Vaughn brings it to the screen with a hilariously depraved edginess.                  "
Leviathan,2014,97,"                      Portions of the work accurately reflect life and reality, but social facts and pressures, like a gravitational force, bend much of the film in false and deeply disoriented ways.                  "

After the Fall,2014,33,"                      Filled with convenient turns and easily attainable avenues of retribution, the film ultimately seems like an archaic example of the dangerous follies of patriarchy.                  "
Furious 7,2015,81,"                      A heartfelt send-off, giving this entry more emotional weight than would be usual. Its primary focus, however, is still on being absurdly entertaining.                  "
Bastards,2013,67,"                      Its pulpy premise and fuzzy the ending didn't really bother me. I hear this was Denis' first foray into digital filmmaking, but with Agnes Godard at the DP helm, the images are just as mesmerizing as her previous films.                  "
Run the Tide,2016,9,                      All of these performances are subjugated to a meandering story with very little idea what it wants to do with them.                  
Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates,2016,38,"                      Obvious Hangover-style scenes eventually fall by the wayside, and the film nicely avoids being yet one more nail in the coffin of contemporary dude-bro romps.                  "

Hawking,2013,85,"                      Taken on its merits, Hawking serves as a useful introduction to -- and a touching, intimate portrait of -- its remarkable subject.                  "

McConkey,2013,100,"                      His life journey was brief but breathtaking, so it's fitting that this first biographical portrait of Shane McConkey matches the same description.                  "

Coherence,2013,88,"                      With very little money at his disposal, Byrkit turns away from special effects and visual bravado and embraces relationship dynamics and philosophical conceits to give his movie a unique sense of self.                  "
Paradise,2013,21,"                      Paradise claims to be the story of young woman's crisis of faith and subsequent rebirth, but in execution, it feels more like a story about someone who was in a bad mood for a while but eventually got over it.                  "

Out of the Dark,2014,50,                      A titillating nasty suspense thriller that has a string of attractive women slashed to death by a serial-killer operating out of LA.                  
Lucy,2014,66,"                      Besson packs a lot of ideas into the brief 89-minute runtime, but he should've spent another 20 minutes on character development.                  "
Mischief Night,2013,100,"                      Despite its shortcomings the film whips along at such a mischievous pace, you are carried away on its wave of enthusiasm.                  "
My Sweet Pepper Land,2013,100,"                      An amusing, touching and subtly transportive film set in a place you'll probably never get to visit.                  "
Fight for Space,2016,100,"                      Although the film is decidedly pro-space, it makes a compelling case that the United States could experience a new era of economic prosperity...                  "
Ugly,2013,63,"                      Kashyap's brilliant five-hour-plus epic is a hard act to follow, and this more pedestrian outing may well disappoint some critics. Still, as genre films go, it's punchy enough to enjoy a charmed life on the fest circuit.                  "
The First Film,2015,91,"                      It's a noble quest, and I applaud Wilkinson for taking it on.                  "

Macbeth,2015,80,                      Through it all Fassbender and Cottilard shine. They both are so keenly in tune with their characters and the unique period dialogue they are given.                  
I Origins,2014,52,"                      There is a great deal wrong with ""I Origins,"" most noticeably the pacing. It is a slow burn, bordering on boring as it moves from one scene to the next.                  "

The 6th Friend,2016,29,"                      My biggest tip for enjoying this slasher film: turn it into a drinking game and take a shot every time you predict what's going to happen.

Manglehorn,2014,49,"                      The problem does not lie with Pacino as such, but with an ""open-ended"" script that does not have sufficient pointedness or purpose to it.                  "

Bang Bang,2014,14,"                      Overall the teenage relationships aren't really delineated, a moralistic twist near the end appears out of nowhere, as does the sudden, unrealistic pairing-up of two of the main characters that gives the film the justification for its subtitle.

"Burzynski: Cancer Is Serious Business, Part II",2013,42,"                      Burzynski may have credibility in the eyes of some, but the movie about him has no credibility, so no one will be receptive to its message.                  "
The Divergent Series: Insurgent,2015,28,"                      Actors like Winslet and Watts have far too much talent to waste it here, whereas the script doesn’t allow for the talented younger supporting cast (namely James and Teller) to deliver much beyond one-note characterizations.                  "
Wolf Totem,2015,67,                      This attempt to say something about the struggle between humans and wild animals is too bombastic and unfeeling.                  
Dark Summer,2015,29,"                      Potential is where Dark Summer ultimately ends; there was much that could have been, instead it's a throwaway teen horror replete with jump scares and convention, but lacking much else.                  "

Chaplin of the Mountains,2013,50,"                      At its best, the film seems as dreary a travelogue as that Nia Vardalos vehicle ""My Life in Ruins.""

The Connection,2014,77,                      Features another superb performance from Jean Dujardin.                  
Visitors,2013,69,"                      These actions have become commonplace, gestures for the office or the subway, but seen on the big screen in Reggio's hypnotic style, we remember just how human they are too.                  "
Far from Men,2014,84,"                      Unique location aside, it will show you many things you have seen before, only now you get to see Viggo Mortensen and Reda Kateb do them. Thing is, they do it good, and the film is never dull or without cinematic beauty.                  "
Electricity,2014,80,"                      Byn Higgins' gritty exploration of a woman consistently betrayed by her own body brings brutal honesty to the subject, eschewing simplicity and singular judgement, (be it good or bad) in favour of a more complex, indeterminate system of empathy.                  "
The Transporter Refueled,2015,15,                      Ten minutes in it's clear why The Transporter: Refueled isn't in 3D. It's because the characters are so one-dimensional they simply couldn't exist in three dimensions.                  
Viktor,2014,0,                      Philip Martinez's Viktor is neither of significant quality nor campy enough to justify its bizarre existence.                  
Endgame,2015,50,"                      There isn't a single surprising development or unforeseen story turn in ""Endgame,"" and yet, as a study in formulaic Screenwriting 101 filmmaking, it's really rather pleasant and sometimes surprisingly moving.                  "
Moebius,2013,79,"                      It's a ballet of dark desires that seems more inventive after a second viewing, when its shock value takes a back seat to its artistry.                  "
Beneath,2014,31,                      It's all so stupefyingly disconnected from any actual human experience it almost maybe sort of spins back around on itself                  
The Circle,2017,15,"                      Regardless of what it teases, “The Circle” doesn’t really go anywhere and that may be its biggest flaw – lots of potential, practically all of it wasted.                  "
Backcountry,2014,92,                      Everything goes just the perfect amount of terrifying.                  
Arlo and Julie,2014,100,                      Alex Dobrenko and Ashley Spillers are perfect for their title roles... and the supporting work from the rest of the small ensemble is delightfully charming as well.                  
Soul,2020,95,"                      ...it should help convince them that even if it’s not something they are great at, all they have to have is passion for its pursuit and that will be more than enough to satisfy their soul’s enrichment.                  "
Bleed,2016,43,"                      Bleed is a supernatural horror film that I want to recommend, but the final act leaves a lot to be desired.                  "
Return to Sender,2015,14,"                      Return to Sender, starring Rosamund Pike, isn't quite what it seems...                  "
Life,2015,51,"                      ...receives plenty of mileage out of the charming, engaging efforts of its two stars...                  "
The Living,2014,50,"                      While the film may end up exactly where you know it should, Wormald keeps it resonant by becoming worse than the men he's seeking to expunge.                  "
State of Play,2013,84,"                      State of Play is a classy piece of Hollywood filmmaking that delivers an entertaining two hours in the cinema and features enjoyable star performances from Russell Crowe, Ben Affleck and Rachel McAdams.                  "
Encanto,2021,91,"                      By exploring the traditional and non-traditional nature of family, their most common modern go-to theme, they keep connected to their familiar and beloved roots while taking audiences on unfamiliar journeys.                  "
Visions,2015,19,                      A hidden gem of an ok movie... I definitely recommend it if you're into watching something a little bit chill but it definitely pays off.                  
First Comes Love,2013,50,"                      Just when you want to shriek at Davenport for her self-absorption, she surprises you with a perception of family life that's as moving as it is true.                  "
Judgment Day,2013,40, 
Bluebird,2015,79,"                      It's a pity Bluebird never quite manages to provide the real emotional payoff that it's seemingly working towards, but it's still an interesting portrait of loss and guilt.                  "
Extraterrestrial,2014,28,                      It's all very unintentionally funny.                  
The Road Within,2014,45,"                      If you're interested in a film for character study, The Road Within is a good start.                  "
Comet,2014,44,"                      ""With 'Comet,' Sam Esmail offers a fresh take on romance and allows his stars to shine with ingenuous performances.""                  "
The Trip to Italy,2014,87,"                      Coogan and Brydon have a pitch-perfect blend of self-effacing comedy and haughty arrogance, culture and setting, and a smart kind of silliness.                  "
Hot Pursuit,2015,8,                      It's great to see a road movie starring two brilliantly talented actresses.                  
One Shot,2013,63,"                      Other characters keep telling us how mysterious and dangerous Jack Reacher is, and yet Cruise’s appearance, clean-cut and trim, doesn’t fit the bill.                  "
Some Girls,2013,55,"                      Unlike Rob in the similar film High Fidelity, we are not left with any growth or self-awareness for Man, the emotional core of the film lays with the female characters who are named (unlike Man) and give complex, layered performances.                  "
The Purge: Anarchy,2014,57,                      Despite the movie’s blundering detour it does get back on track just in time to provide an unexpected satisfying ending.                  
The Nightingale,2013,90,"                      The Nightingale is a beautifully photographed, well-acted parable about tradition and change in modern-day China, that will either move you to tears or strike you as overly saccharine and formulaic.                  "
Violette,2013,86,"                      This well-acted, wonderfully photographed biopic explores the troubled life of French feminist author Violette Leduc and her complicated ties to Simone de Beauvoir...                  "
Dolphin Tale 2,2014,66,"                      The two F's are front and center-family and friends-along with lessons in determination and fighting for what you believe in. Good stuff all round, if a little ham-fisted in its presentation.                  "
Abandoned,2022,20,                      Abandoned is how to describe any hope that viewers might have that this dull and idiotic horror flick will be scary or interesting. It's the type of derivative haunted house movie that's just recycled trash.                   
The Theory of Everything,2014,80,                      There is still a good story to be found in “The Theory of Everything” despite its standard biopic flavor and rushed ending.                  
The Guest,2014,92,                      Stevens elevates The Guest into an experience every bit as tricky and intelligent as You’re Next.                  
Highway,2014,88,                      The action is held together by a star-making performance from Alia Bhatt.                  
Death House,2017,40,"                      Derivative and uninspired, Death House may have its moments but it has far too little in between to justify the 95 minute running time.                  "
Carrie Pilby,2016,63,                      Carrie Pilby is an upbeat comedy that is a comfort to anyone who has ever felt alone in the city.                  
Lion,2015,84,"                      Aside from one slightly underserved relationship and the film drifting a tad in the second half, “Lion” eloquently handles this incredible multi-layered story. Patel’s leading man star has never shown brighter.                  "
Bypass,2014,44,"                      Bypass is a disappointment, with obvious talent going to waste due to too much emphasis on aesthetics and not enough to telling an original and gripping story.                  "
Eastern Boys,2013,89,                      How this all sorts itself out is a nail-biting treat...                  
Spark,2016,13,"                      Honestly, this movie was absolutely painful. Not because it was frustratingly terrible, but because of how this was such a wasted opportunity.                  "
Black Coffee,2014,40,"                      Black Coffee never resorts to stale melodrama or cheap laughs, sticking true to a low key straight romance between characters that aren't locked into stereotype.                  "
Animal,2014,43,"                      This film is predictable, stereotypical, and has some plot holes that drove me nuts. Despite these shortcomings, the acting, practical effects, and healthy amount of gore still make the film fun to watch.                  "
Fever,2014,57, 
Joker,2013,0,"                      Can kids watch this, I asked myself as I watched this all-over-the-place faradiddle. And then I dismissed it. Because even children, especially children, need a story that holds, and characters that engage.                  "
Gabrielle,2013,89,"                      This thought provoking French language film is a tender tearjerker, but undeniably soul-stirring. Marion-Rivard, in her debut performance, is riveting and lovable; a character you can't help but root for.                  "
Edge of the World,2021,56,"                      A rare bird, not because of what it's like but because it makes you ask: why was it made? [Full review in Spanish]                  "
Boy Meets Girl,2014,89,                      Both robust and delicate. It easily captures the natural rhythms of contemporary speech... while it raises intimate issues with great clarity and sensitivity.                  
Coming Home,2014,89,"                      A small, sincere film about big, complex times...                  "
The Goob,2014,85,"                      The bleakly beautiful Norfolk backdrops subvert cliché, but the characters' obeisance to tinpot tyrant Gene leaves an inexplicable hole at the heart of the film.                  "
Ode to Joy,2019,45,"                      Cataplexy, in turn, is more of a plot gimmick - a sad case of missed opportunity. Even the laughs are few and far between.                  "
Wild Tales,2014,94,"                      Not every story will resonate, and the overall theme doesn't leave one with a sense of their combined profundity, but three or four stories are bound to feel familiar and thus deliciously watchable.                  "
Hangman,2017,4,                      Lord save me from screenwriters who don't know how to end their movies with dignity.                  
Life of an Actress: The Musical,2014,0,"                      A cringe-worthy, stilted, awkward and bloated mess.                  "
Miracle,2013,81,"                      If you can get past the jingoism, Miracle's a good story about an exceptional hockey coach.                  "
Intruder,2016,23,"                      ... entertaining and creepy, definitely worth a watch in a dark room, possibly alone to make its ambiance work even better.                  "
Criminal,2016,29,"                      A dull, yet star-studded production that feels like a 1990s action movie throwback - complete with over-the-top villains, ruthless violence, and an absurd premise.                  "
Finding Altamira,2016,65,                      Feels like the kind of movie your science teacher ran in class when they didn't feel like lecturing.                  
Happy Ending,2014,33,"                      There is enough in the story to provide you a good dose of entertainment, you just don't need to expect too much.                  "
Stonewall,2015,9,"                      Instead of showing us the real story, Emmerich thought his fictional character was was more interesting. I'd say that's pretty damn arrogant.                  "
Quitters,2015,44,"                      Quitters has more style than substance, but it's a cut above most, mainly because first-time director and co-writer Noah Pritzker has a lot of sensitivity toward a familiar subject that renders it real and touching if not exactly original.                  "
Belle,2014,85,"                      Belle is appealing: intelligent, engaged and self-possessed.                   "
Diane,2017,93,"                      Mary Kay Place never goes for the jugular with any of the material, knowing full well how to make us lean in and feel something just by virtue of her beautiful stillness.                  "
The Sound and the Fury,2014,22,                      James Franco's messy Faulkner adaptation has mature themes.                  
Flock of Dudes,2016,36,"                      This is a movie that disappoints because its cast is really giving it their all, but the script isn't on the same level as their performances - perhaps it just need a little more time to grow up.                  "
Pressure,2015,38,"                      Too baggy for its moments of unease to resonate throughout an already lean runtime, Pressure can't quite rise above the level of mediocrity. At least it tries though.                  "
Eden,2014,85,"                      Eden may function as an inauspicious window into the distressing real world of sex works, but its underlying story not only deserves but positively demands a far more considerate and attentive approach than is shown here.                  "
Ovation,2015,38,"                      Sadly, the quality of the production gets shakier as we pass the half-hour mark. The camerawork is okay, but what the camera is recording wouldn't pass muster for your average high school senior play.                  "
Buddy,2013,26, 
Colossus,2013,40,"                      Shows more than a few flashes of wit, intelligence and craft amid all the excess.                  "
Club Life,2015,20,"                      While [director Fabrizio] Conte's directorial debut is thematically hard to digest, it's worth noting that the performances really make the film watchable.                  "
The Jungle Book,2016,94,"                      While it has been years since I’ve seen the original, Favreau’s freshened up version pulls just as much from Rudyard Kipling’s 1894 stories as the animated feature.                  "
Asthma,2014,10,"                      Jake Hoffman's feature film directorial debut, Asthma, deploys almost every romantic comedy trope there is, all the while throwing in heroin to give it some street cred.                  "
Nightingale,2014,85,                      James Gray’s story is engaging and heartbreaking. His characters are interesting and compelling.                  
Parched,2015,86,"                      Parched is rarely able to get past its mindfulness of being a film with a message, thus failing to lose itself in a story of real people with real, heart-wrenching problems.                  "
Gold Star,2017,88,"                      As an examination of the ways in which we experience grief for the still-living, Gold Star is a remarkably insightful experience.                  "
Spaceship,2016,53,"                      Written and directed by Taylor, it may be a difficult story structure for some to follow but once you open your mind to all the possibilities out there, you can quickly find yourself immersed into this otherworldly story.                  "
Before I Disappear,2014,37,"                      It's a tale that requires a strong, emotional component to be successful, and its glaring absence only becomes more and more apparent.                  "
The New Black,2013,85,                      A smart and empathetic portrait of the African-American community's struggle with the issue of same-sex marriage                  
Cub,2014,40,"                      Cub is not your average horror film, reaching depths not previously visited in the genre. It could be seen to many as an origin tale of the likes of Jason and Michael Myers, making it a must for genre fans.                   "
Inferno,2016,23,"                      The arrival of Inferno, Howard's treatment of the fourth novel in Brown's series, feels marked by the underwhelming previous efforts and a decided sense of obligation toward maintaining an unwanted franchise.                  "
Buddy,2013,26,
The Royal Road,2015,82,                      It's reminiscent of Chris Ware's Building Stories: people are fleeting but the building remains. The Royal Road is as much of a love letter to a place as it is a love letter to a person.                  
He Named Me Malala,2015,72,"                      Ultimately, this gentle documentary is less interested in the typical needs of drama and more in the patient, accepting demeanor of the remarkable young woman at its heart.                  "
The Forbidden Room,2015,96,"                      The outside world, like centenarian film-stock, dissolves in acid-hued pools right around you. Outside world? What outside world? We are all film down here.                  "
The Editor,2014,58,                      Just a bundle of fun but what I will say about it is you have to be in the right headspace to watch it.                  
Hardcore Henry,2015,51,"                      Naishuller's presentation begins to numb the viewer about midway through, leaving us hungry for the story's few remaining kernels of plot instead of another of its chaotic set pieces.                  "
Committed,2014,43,"                      Committed isn't [Heather] Graham's fault. If, for the first time on screen, she's charmless and annoying, it's better to pin the fault on director/writer Lisa Krueger, whose simplistic moralizing keeps Committed a dull, trying experience.                  "
Creed,2015,95,"                      “Creed” has its clichés and its big mandatory crowd-pleasing moments, but even they are handled well by a confident filmmaker who is a true rising talent.                  "
Spy,2015,95,"                      If you want something fresh, intelligent, and outside of the modern norm good luck finding it here.                  "
Rocky,2013,91,                      Rocky is not only the best sports film ever made but one of the best feel-good movies ever made.                  
See You in Valhalla,2015,0,                      The characters feel familiar and the scenarios are contrived in this low-budget drama.                  
Artemis Fowl,2020,8,                      A fruitless franchise launch for a series I doubt we will ever see again.                  
Violet,2014,85,                      Devos knows just about how long to hold a mute static shot or hover over youth inhabiting suburbia to have resonance and depth. The 7 minute one shot ending is worthy of Antonioni comparison.                  
At Berkeley,2013,87,"                      An uninhibited paean to the classroom and a rousing endorsement of the wider availability of higher learning, Wiseman's doc is a pedagogic experience to be thankful for.                  "
Memphis,2013,74,"                      While Memphis may not always engage as powerfully as it could, it's a striking experimental portrait of the pressure to create for the consumption of others.                  "
Cymbeline,2014,33,"                      This is a film without a wide range of emotions, they remain mostly on the somber side, but those explored are seriously explored. The overall mood is one of sympathy for the young, the marginalized, the rebellious.                  "
Echoes of War,2015,31,                      [A] sluggish post-Civil War drama directed and co-written by Kane Senes that wears its shopworn ideas too heavily on its sleeve.                  
Monster Trucks,2016,32,                      TODAY! TODAY! TODAY! The worst movie on four wheels! No adrenaline pumping action! Monster Trucks! We'll sell you the whole seat... to make it easy to take a nap!                  
Tony,2013,76,                      Johnson gives us enough of the inner life of the titular character to both empathise with then later hate him.                  
Victory,2013,63,                      Intermittently entertaining if also exceedingly imbecilic.                  
Tusk,2014,45,"                      The material never quite commits itself tonally. Some scenes feel like a grotesque chiller, others play like your usual Smith-brand comedy. When Smith tries to combine these two tones, the unbalanced result is more awkward than enjoyable.                  "
Manhattan Night,2016,35,                      As the movie slowly winds its way toward its anti-climatic final scenes it becomes clear that no amount of stylish direction or outrageous characters can make up for the far-fetched and convoluted story.                  
Ghoul,2015,22,                      It went into a whole lot of just trying to please the audience and I wasn't really about it... but there were some really good subplots in this movie.                  
Story of My Death,2013,75,"                      ... fails to do more than set up an encounter between two seducers, Casanova and Dracula. The latter comes off worse. Are you surprised?                  "
When Evening Falls on Bucharest or Metabolism,2013,69,                      I step away from When Evening Falls on Bucharest or Metabolism with more questions than answers.                  
Distant,2013,87,"                      It is very sad but also very beautiful. (Particularly after snow flocks the gray-on-gray city.) There is one breathtaking moment, a scene involving a beached tanker in snow, that is merely the best of dozens of indelible fragments.                  "
Homesick,2015,50,                      Sewitsky's strenuous attempts to make an unsensational and non-judgemental film on a weighty subject result in a film that throws its back out.                  
The Good House,2021,72,"                      Hildy deserves a second chance at love, but the core of the film — in Weaver’s remarkably capable hands — is her love/hate relationship with alcohol. It’s a relationship many of us can relate to. Weaver’s performance makes 'The Good House' pretty great.                   "
Crazy Rich Asians,2018,91,"                      “Crazy Rich Asians” doesn’t reinvent the romantic comedy or stretch it in any new directions. The ‘fish out of water’, ‘meet the parents’, and ‘rags meets riches’ story elements have been done many times before. This film simply does them better.                  "
Watermark,2013,77,"                      Watermark is a kind of mega hydro project of its own, generating waves of shock and awe.                  "
Pimp,2018,56,"                      A snappy one-note lesbian love story set in the mean Bronx streets, that sells its ass as a sleazy '70s blaxploitation film.                  "
Tempest Storm,2016,40,"                      Mainly, the film suffers because Storm is not at all introspective. It's all access and no insight.                  "
The World of Kanako,2014,68,                      The nihilistic atmosphere eventually becomes so oppressive that it swallows everything in its path.                  
Misconception,2014,40,                      An illuminating documentary that presents three different perspectives on the challenges of overpopulation.                  
Now You See Me 2,2016,34,                      The smoke-and-mirrors story flies all over the place and never firmly lands anywhere.                  
Lost Girls,2020,74,                      Award-winning filmmaker Liz Garbus’s first scripted feature is a film that is hard to recommend or disregard. Lost Girls would have been better suited as a documentary film.                  
Mea culpa,2014,83,"                      Though unreservedly generic - particularly in the storytelling and the indistinctive narrative structure, Mea Culpa remains a picture that's easy to indulge yourself in.                  "
The Heart Machine,2014,95,"                      More of an exercise in the complications of modern love than an astute portrait of two people trying to come together, The Heart Machine exudes the robotic connotations of its title.                  "
Circle,2015,57,"                      If you're aching for some more kill-or-be-killed drama in the vein of Squid Game with a surreal sci-fi bent à la 1997's Cube or Hiroya Oku's Gantz, then Cube is certainly worth a watch.                  "
Intruders,2013,31,"                      Aside from Owen and Van Houten, who both have natural presence, there’s nothing here except dissatisfaction and ridicule waiting in the shadows.                  "
Stray Dogs,2013,86,"                      Patience is not only a respected virtue, but with slow cinema such as this, it is also a mandatory implement for emotional and thematic decryption that promises to yield treasures of immense cinematic wealth.                  "
Take Care,2014,25,"                      Needy and broad, Take Care is an exhausting experience for all the wrong reasons.                  "
Little Feet,2013,75,"                      It's excusable for a sheltered novice filmmaker to be out of touch like this, but not for a veteran.                  "
Almost There,2014,82,"                      Narrated by the 83-year-old Anton, the documentary takes on even more emotional punch as you hear the joy, the sadness, the pain, the anticipation in his time-weary voice; no ""talking head"" could have done his story justice.                  "
Little Accidents,2014,54,"                      A very profound and thought-provoking character study, as well as a study of the human condition.                  "
Pasolini,2014,78,"                      A frustrating disappointment ... sluggish and slow, as if Ferrara either dreads having to find his way to Ostia Beach-where Pasolini was murdered-or finds pleasure in the foreplay.                  "
Dealt,2017,96,                      His wife even claims she's caught him practicing during sex.                  
Snowflake,2017,100,"                      It's ... entertaining, but it has too much in it that is just there for the sake of being there creating a film that is odd to watch and feels a bit off.                  "
Juggernaut,2017,57,"                      Even if the ending falls something short of memorable, ""Juggernaut"" still holds attention as a strong, well-acted effort that effectively walks the line between dysfunctional family drama and revenge thriller.                  "
The Last Time You Had Fun,2014,67,                      Earns enough good will to carry us through this night-in-a-rented-limo adventure to its sunrise conclusion.                  
Gold,2014,67,                      One of the stand-out aspects of the film is Nesbitt's performance as the self-obsessed and deluded Frank McGunn.                  
Jimmy Vestvood: Amerikan Hero,2016,83,"                      In the style of Borat, director Jonathan Kesselman and cowriters Jobrani and Amir Ohebsion use raunchy, puerile humor to jab at American prejudices toward the Middle East.                  "
Shelter,2014,46,"                      Bettany's film is a sincere effort to depict the extreme vulnerability of those who live without shelter, in many cases dying because they are excluded by a vicious system without any kind of social safety net.                  "
Staten Island Summer,2015,31,"                      If [Colin] Jost is angling for a big-screen, or in this case laptop screen, career, Staten Island Summer is an inauspicious start.                  "
Into the Ashes,2019,30,"                      Luke Grimes and Frank Grillo headline this dark and beautifully shot revenge tale, out on demand and in limited theaters. A gritty indie flick worth seeing.                  "
Preservation,2014,50,                      It dulls the edges right off of any wicked turns it makes its move for                  
Swing,2013,83,                      A deceptively straightforward film with enough grooves and riffs to charm even the most tone-deaf viewer . . . Gatlif's film has a brisk energy and bracing passion                  
Take Me to the River,2015,73,                      An excellent piece of work imbued with a specific sense of place.                  
Commitment,2013,40,"                      Commitment may not be the next big K-cinema import, but it's a fine display of solid craftsmanship.                  "
Hits,2014,35,"                      Considerably well-written throughout, Hits' only fault lies in its lamentable withholding of some of the more substantial elements of its tongue-in-cheek narrative statement.                  "
Desierto,2015,63,                      Isolated terrain featuring looming rock formations and challenging stretches of desert contribute to the story's menacing elements.                  
The Circle,2014,100,"                      Even though the stories are hard to keep track of, the film is powerful and inspiring.                  "
Gabriel,2013,84,"                      [Writer/Director Lou] Howe should be commended for taking on such a mature project that has its moments of intrigue, but Gabriel just never quite gets there.                  "
Trainwreck,2015,84,"                      It's worth enduring a few inane jokes and about a half-hour of pointless material to experience the smart, funny, raunchy, and touching humor Schumer and Apatow deliver.                  "
Listening,2014,17,"                      It seems to be a final project in Khalil Sullins' career, but without the clarity of ideas to do something minimally consistent.. [Full Review in Spanish]                  "
Drift,2013,32,"                      The surfing scenes are exhilarating, the waves more terrifying than anything Eli Roth or James Wan could come up with.                  "
Walt Before Mickey,2015,17,                      The great man certainly deserves better that is for sure.                  
Win It All,2017,85,                      ...a low-key character study that consistently benefits from Johnson's often spellbindingly accomplished performance...                  
All Together Now,2020,69,"                      Silver Linings Playbook was good at dissecting relationships, but All Together Now seems to have been dashed off and comes to our screens underwritten.                  "
Hide and Seek,2013,12,
Welcome Back,2015,40,                      It's not funny that able-minded humans spend 150 minutes demonstrating to us what a LSD-fueled midlife crisis would look like.                  
Uncle Nick,2015,45,                      ...could only have worked as a short.                  
Swing,2002,83,                      A deceptively straightforward film with enough grooves and riffs to charm even the most tone-deaf viewer . . . Gatlif's film has a brisk energy and bracing passion                  
Ballet 422,2014,87,                      Refreshing.                  
The Condemned,2013,0,"                      The Condemned is trying to tap into a dark past of exploitation and other horrors, but instead throws out its spices and mutes them in a generic ghost story.                  "
Sleeping with Other People,2015,63,                      Might have been more effective if it didn't adhere so strictly to the old possum that men and women can't be friends.                  
Mr. Holmes,2015,88,                      An unlikely friendship Holmes forms with his housekeeper's young son (child actor Milo Parker) proves especially affecting.                  
Pride,2014,92,                      [One of] the most joyful films in existence...                  
Retribution,2015,100,                      ...a top-tier contemporary thriller.                  
A Violent Separation,2019,17,                      B-film thriller (more a melodrama).                  
Room,2015,93,                      There is an underlying hope to “Room” that is even present during the most grim moments.                  
Circus,2009,9, 
Undrafted,2016,25,"                      Mazzello pens a smart script worthy of a theater stage. Like its intramural baseball team, underdog film Undrafted captures the magic of a ball game and the price of big dreams.                  "
The Diary of a Teenage Girl,2015,95,                      Bless every independent fiber of it being true to its own vigorous heartbeat.                  
Hacker,2016,0,                      Anonymous mocks the idealism of anarchy by way of a ridiculously romantic depiction of online crime; it feels like a rom-com version of the far more weighted series Mr. Robot.                  
The Mother,2013,78,"                      Quite apart from her unclad courage in the sex scenes, 62-year-old Anne Reid conveys the dilemmas of her age and her hesitant path to liberation with extraordinary and moving subtlety.                  "
"No Pay, Nudity",2016,71,"                      No Pay, Nudity is a good example of why studio executives don't want to throw money at pictures in which not much happens: If they aren't very good, they tend to be very dull.                  "
Honeymoon,2014,76,"                      Honeymoon is a twisted, unpredictable horror thriller that will leave you shocked in the end.                  "
Momentum,2015,26,"                      The best thing about Momentum, this year's least anticipated political-gangster thriller, is its Stomp-style opening credit sequence. It gets a bit hammy after that.                  "
The Boy Next Door,2015,12,                      “The Boy Next Door” is too unconsciously goofy to be taken seriously and it takes itself too seriously to be good campy fun.                   
Blackbird,2014,83,                      A sense of déjà vu hangs heavy over the movie's every frame.                  
Bitter Harvest,2017,15,                      It's a bad sign when even the prayers in this movie are crappy.                  
Veronica,2017,78,"                      This is another case of true story horror films really doing their job. Paco Plaza already proved himself as a horror force to be reckoned with...but he really outdoes himself with Veronica, outshining even the best of James Wan's supernatural shockers.                  "
Hellion,2014,60,"                      Kat Candler's exploration of toxic male adolescence is handsome and haunting, with a star-making performance by young star Josh Wiggins...                  "
Xenia,2014,86,"                      What Xenia captures (successfully, repeatedly) is that uncomfortable late teen age, where you're grasping desperately for your childhood and its safe comforts, and also itching to become new, independent, and powerful.                  "
Dirty Weekend,2015,30,"                      Strangely, to the film's credit, it unexpectedly ends in a quietly complex and sweet place. I don't quite think the slow-stepping plot is worth the outcome, but the consistent tone does pay off.                  "
Silence,2013,91,"                      Silence amalgamates photography, cartography and the quiet contemplation that peace and solitude can evoke into a rich, sensual tapestry.                  "
Insidious: Chapter 3,2015,57,"                      Much like the Saw or Paranormal Activity franchises, the stories have run out but the filmmakers cannot resist making another sequel.                  "
Kill Zone 2,2015,100,"                      These kinetic action sequences can't be done justice in a written review, but the good news is that they really do deliver the goods.                  "
Extinction,2018,32,                      Feels as if it would work better as a pilot for a television series - perhaps chiefly because the conclusion is a mere setup for further tales in this speculative world.                  
Lou! Journal infime,2014,17,                      Quirky French subtitled film about growing up has profanity.                  
Reckless,2014,0,"                      Youth on the run can be a whole lot of fun, but Reckless, by first-time filmmaker James Foley, is a particularly dreary affair.                  "
Metamorphoses,2014,67,"                      Playful, dirty, edgy and wondrous in its micro-economic way, Metamorphoses works as it is intended to- a beautiful, dreamy poetry in accordance with the spirit of French New Wave.                  "
Reclaim,2014,0,                      A totally routine movie that tries to combine a message about trafficked children with a lowbrow thriller about loved ones going missing in a foreign country.                  
Macbeth,2012,49,"                      Something weakened this way comes, you could say.                  "
My Prairie Home,2013,100,                      My Prairie Home is more than pretty skies and poetic wheat fields. It's also about growing up different in a difficult environment and what it means to survive.                  
Bad Samaritan,2018,53,"                      Bad Samaritan is the tale of an immigrant taking on a dangerous, out of touch, entitled, rich asshole. There's a dose of politically charged wish fulfillment in that, which makes an already fun movie even more of a blast.                  "
The Cobbler,2014,10,"                      The influence of the present conditions in America, as reflected through a limited and rather predictable artistic prism, largely derails The Cobbler.                  "
The Dinner,2017,46,                      Gifted with a terrific ensemble cast all at the top of their game here.                  
Like Me,2017,69,"                      A movie made for the ADHD generation? With all the excess style, I liked Like Me much more than I thought I would. Its textural, rough around the edges aesthetics really works for its there/not there theme. One of the year's best.                  "
Slow West,2015,92,                      A compelling story set within familiar Western boundaries but strikingly original in the paths it takes.                  
Romeo and Juliet,2013,23,                      It has the look of someone sitting in front of the mirror painting themselves silly with all the finest cosmetic supplies while singing 'I feel pretty.'                  
Son of God,2014,20,                      ... an infusion of banality. [Full review in Spanish]                  
The Price,2017,83,"                      The Price has a persistent feeling of having been here and done this, but as far as these morality plays are concerned, it's adequate. Ameen gives a strongly empathetic lead performance.                  "
Actress,2014,89,"                      Greene's experimental approach, along with the haunting beauty of his film's star, makes for a fascinating look into the artifice inherent in documentary filmmaking and our own lives.                  "
Rise,2014,17,"                      May not quite be the entertaining and inspirational film that it aspires to be, but it does tell an involving and important story.                  "
Video Games: The Movie,2014,18,                      Homage to gaming pioneers is tween friendly but overlong.

Passion,2013,33,"                      All the director’s themes are at play in Passion: obsession, voyeurism, eroticism, murder, and the warped mind of a killer—they’re all present. But they never come alive in the sensational way they do in his best films.                  "

A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood,2019,95,"                      Tom Hanks is the perfect choice for this (role), someone we all associate with the same warmth and affection as Rogers. A very uplifting film, that gives you a bit of faith in just how good people can be.                   "
"Gahan Wilson: Born Dead, Still Weird",2013,100,                      Steven-Charles Jaffe's film is a fascinating profile of one of cartooning's best and most venerable workhorses.

Cruella,2021,74,"                      Cruella is pure, perfect big studio escapism. It’s a witty, suspenseful, ultra-cool, killer Disney live-action triumph.                  "
The Blue Room,2014,89,                      Lukewarm when it should boil and tepid when it should chill to the bone

The Empty Hours,2013,86,                      It stays with you in ways you'd hardly expect from a deceptively simple tale of a boy coming face-to-face with career-driven independence - and all the responsibilities that come with it.                  
Restoring Tomorrow,2016,100,"                      This filmmaker has much to say about humanity's need for faith, community, and sense of history, but the reasoning for these revelations feels myopic                  "

The Good Son,2012,82,"                      The singular focus is not a fatal flaw. Not at all, really. It's merely a question haunting The Good Son even when its concentration steers the viewer away from it.                  "
Beyond Clueless,2014,75,                      Beyond Clueless frequently provokes nostalgic joy whilst also inspiring further cinematic discovery.                  
Waiting for August,2014,100,"                      Waiting for August is gorgeously shot and compelling in its narrative as the director manages to remain completely subjective in her portrayal of this situation, allowing us as an audience to draw our own conclusions.                  "

The Last Race,2018,93,"                      Still, while the world The Last Race shows is in decline, perhaps it deserves to survive.                  "

Concerning Violence,2014,90,"                      This is a clarion call to remember that history is never quite over, it's a living breathing organism that refutes the practises and narrative of 'winners' and 'losers', and pushes us to think of the here and now.                  "
Sully,2016,85,"                      Eastwood made a wise casting choice, and Hanks makes the transparent qualities of Sully work more than they should.                  "
Red Army,2014,92,"                      I'm not much of a sportsman, much less a hockey fan, but this meticulously crafted documentary is a knockout.                  "
November Criminals,2017,0,"                      ...precisely the kind of movie that I wish I could recommend simply to spark conversation on how not to tackle issues of race in a film, but it is such a dull and lifeless experience that it can't even serve that purpose.                  "
Black Rose,2014,22,                      The film is one of those odd ducks in action films that manages to recapture the feeling of a bygone era that so many other filmmakers are trying to do or homage. Black Rose manages it without feeling forced or like that was even the goal.                  
Any Day,2015,0,"                      An earnest, utterly predictable indie that wastes a couple of decent performances in service of a hackneyed and weak script ...                  "
Advanced Style,2014,89,"                      Fashion is the movie's McGuffin, the thing that brings all these people together and bonds them, but it's the women's spirit and their attitude to aging that informs every minute of this documentary.                  "

Captive,2015,27,"                      CAPTIVE won't dazzle you in the way the masters of mystery will, but the uncannily consistent work from Oyelowo and its positive outlook will indeed keep you captivated.                  "
Unrest,2017,100,                      This pre-pandemic snapshot is prophetic in its detailing of telecommunication applications that the disabled use to create community online.                  
Trapped,2013,17,                      Luis Mandoki's movie Trapped is one of the most inept hostage thrillers I've ever seen.                  
The Mend,2014,78,"                      The Mend lacks true mayhem or insight, resulting in a repeating scherzo without a coda.                  "
Reminiscence,2021,36,"                      Reminiscence is full of potential but fails to live up to it. It aims for the heights of hard boiled film noir classic but sadly the result is nearer soft boiled. For a film all about the power of memory, the end result is ironically entirely forgettable.                  "
The Three Musketeers,2013,26,                      The only thing that really saves the day is Christoph Waltz.                  
Heartbeat,2014,80,"                      The standout is Clattenburg, in her film debut, who turns in a sensitive, natural performance that keeps the movie firmly in our shabby houses, on our leaf-covered streets, wielding our instruments for all the world to see.                  "
Heist,2015,29,"                      Working in this film's favor is the aforementioned brisk pace and the taut editing. It somehow adds to the sense of desperation and urgency that the lead pair feels. Overall, a passable action potboiler.                  "
Hinterland,2014,70,"                      Although it has its self-indulgent longueurs and its faults, there are moments when it is genuinely touching.                  "
Creative Control,2015,61,"                      Equal parts satire and science fiction, but how Dickinson and his team present these images is what makes a movie about disengaging so engaging.                  "
Tale of Tales,2015,83,"                      Though the film is decidedly not for children, it remains almost revisionist in its faithfully disturbing origins.                  "
Last Days in Vietnam,2014,95,                      Kennedy's take on this dark and convoluted quagmire finds its balance somewhere between oblique reportage and post-hoc apologia.                  
Cult of Chucky,2017,78,"                      Don Mancini takes a completely different approach (both narratively and aesthetically) in 'Cult of Chucky', proving you just can't keep a Good Guy down in the franchise's sixth sequel.                  "
Little Women,2019,95,                      A truly great movie filled with an effervescent female spirit that celebrates the joy of family and the unbreakable bond of sisterhood.                  
Domino,2019,32,                      Production issues were evident in Domino and the over-stylized pace kills any suspense it tries to build.                  
Best Worst Thing That Ever Could Have Happened,2016,95,"                      In other words, The Best Worst Thing That Ever Could Have Happened essentially is Merrily We Roll Along, executed with success.                  "
Arabian Nights: Volume 1 - The Restless One,2015,97,"                      Political films are often boring. Well intentioned films are even more boring. But since it's Miguel Gomes, the director of such genre defining, inventive, playful films as Our Beloved Month of August and Tabu, Arabian Nights is nothing but.                  "
The Last Face,2016,8,"                      Is Penn actually comparing the ""brutality"" of civil war in Africa to the ""brutality"" of personal relationships among Western professionals?                  "
Leave the World Behind,2014,75,"                      No matter how much I fought it, there's no denying the power of Swedish House Mafia's music; admittedly, I left the theater with the acoustic version of their infamous hit ""Don't You Worry Child"" playing in my head, and it didn't stop for days.                  "
Good Luck,2017,100,"                      The film feels less like a documentary than like a work of abstract expressionism, yet much beauty can be found in [director Ben] Russell's approach.                  "
Two Step,2014,100,                      The concise characterization and slow boil build make Two Step a worthy addition to the Texas thriller sub-genre.                  
Equals,2015,36,"                      In a film centered on characters being overwhelmed by stirring emotions, that reaction does not transfer successfully to the audience.                  "
Uzumasa Limelight,2014,91,"                      Uzumasa Limelight is a great film about films, which, although takes the side of the veterans, ends up depicting hope for both them and the Japanese cinema in general                  "

The Public,2018,66,"                      When you combine The Public’s penchant for cheap sentiment and its social advocacy message, you get the equivalent of cinematic social conscience fluffernutter that is spread too thin.                  "
The Man with the Iron Heart,2017,67,                      The Man with an Iron Heart is a well-acted film recounting one of the bravest assassination attempts in history.                  
Blind Date,2013,24,"                      Rambo, the family Great Dane, provides the film with some of its funniest visual and aural gags.                  "
The Crash,2017,17,"                      Several respectable actors offer dicey performances here, but Rappaport's screenplay is the real villain, expecting thin references to real-world financial peril to paper over gaping holes in credibility and plain-old drama.                  "
Animals,2014,86,"                      Animals is a tough, but poetic film. It's about two drug addicts living in a car, in love, trapped in their habits, and fighting to change their ways.                  "
The Revenant,2012,56,"                      D. Kerry Prior's limited experience mostly lies in SFX, but you wouldn't know it from what is perfect comedy timing.                  "
Extraction,2015,6,"                      Like many films of its kind, wants to be smart when it isn't, rather than accept itself and just be fun. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
Trespass Against Us,2016,56,"                      Director Adam Smith wallows a little too long in Chad's plight, but with two ever-watchable actors like Fassbender and Gleeson, 'Trespass Against Us' rises from the mire just enough.                  "
Be Afraid,2017,9,"                      [U]ltimately it felt like a TV movie, and I really wanted more than that.                  "

Castles in the Sky,2014,67,                      Castles In The Sky may well be modest in scale (and likely to have a greater life on television rather than the big-screen) but it's an entertaining look at a delightfully eccentric and brilliant scientist.                  
The Last Man,2019,0,"                      A dreary, shapeless, grey-green, post-apocalyptic incel sex fantasy, The Last Man is a chore from start to finish.                  "

Logan,2017,94,"                      There are no punchy jokes or one-liners. There are no colorful, larger than life characters. Mangold’s tone remains intensely serious and his characters are broken and struggling.                  "
American Ultra,2015,44,"                      A rather exciting, downright visceral, very often romantic, and unexpectedly fun experience.                  "
MI-5,2015,63,"                      Spooks' pre-exisiting excellence hinders the film somewhat as it struggles to make a cinematic splash; worth watching if you're already a fan, or appreciate fast-paced shenanigans and explosions around London.                  "
Diverge,2016,80,"                      The resulting film feels almost entirely divorced from notions of entertainment or thematic exploration, instead relying on final moments of emotional investment that the film never expends the effort to develop or earn.                  "

Hungry Hearts,2014,63,"                      The momentum of the character arcs drags at one or two key moments, but this is a remarkably even-handed and tense portrayal of a family caught between love and logic.                  "
DamNation,2014,50,"                      ""DamNation"" does little in the way of presenting the pros alongside the cons of dams, resulting in cheerful feature-length propaganda that seems to be disagreeing with no one in particular.                  "
Jigsaw,2017,32,"                      Gorehounds will get their fill, and that's about the limit of Jigsaw's appeal.                  "
Bad Kids of Crestview Academy,2017,10,"                      In the end, Bad Kids of Crestview Academy squanders its mystery on telling a joke it has told several times already, and all tension leaves the film, making it hard to care for the remaining survivors.                  "
VooDoo,2017,30,                      A relentlessly twisted affair.

Friend Request,2016,17,"                      Friend Request is an attempt to get the Halloween crowd a few weeks early, but it's the type of invitation you should just ignore.                  "
Tolkien,2019,51,"                      Despite some heavy-handed references to the Middle Earth books, Tolkien is a well-acted and well-directed film that sheds some light on one of the most beloved authors who ever lived.                  "
Sink,2018,100,"                      It's a different, less overtly polemical approach to that of Loach, but it's another powerful take on the issues facing Britain today.                  "
Compadres,2016,40,"                      Buddy action comedy from Mexico is convoluted, violent.                  "

Transformers: The Last Knight,2017,16,
Iron Man,2013,94,"                      When all is said and done, this is, without a doubt, the Robert Downey Jr. show from start to finish.                  "
Kill Dil,2014,50,"                      There are too many ""creative escapades"" in the film. Out of the blue, the actors decide to escape to deserts and seasides, mainly to make a particular song look beautiful. The songs in the movie are interruptions in the narrative.                  "
Breakdown,2016,10,                      Breakdown doesn't do enough to distinguish itself from an overcrowded canon of distinctly average British film.                  
Artist,2013,95,"                      It is an appreciation of silent cinema from a director who quite deftly incorporates the flavor of silent moviemaking, with its physically expressive acting, longer shots, and more patient editing rhythms, with a more modern sensibility...                  "
A United Kingdom,2016,84,"                      A welcome reminder that, even in the direst of situations and in the most impossible of times, love can indeed trump hate.                  "
Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark,2019,77,"                      When Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark brings Gammell's art to life, it's terrifying.                  "
The Forest,2016,10,"                      Instead of turning the forest into a place where Japanese people find some kind of sad and disturbing comfort on a mass scale, the filmmakers have chosen to turn the place into a haunted house.                  "
The Taking of Deborah Logan,2014,91,                      A smart and clever found footage film that uses the tropes of the subgenre to examine mental illness. The presence of a refreshingly low-key queer character and a stunningly vulnerable performance by Jill Larson make this a must-watch.                  
Night of the Living Dead,2014,96,                      The cruel and abrupt ending is still shattering and feels even more depressingly plausible today.                  
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,2016,38,"                      Despite the efforts of Cruise and Smulders, things never rise above predictable and/or formulaic.                  "
Spring,2014,85,"                      It's really unique, it kind of has its own sub-genre and I really recommend it to everybody.                  "
Stefan Zweig: Farewell to Europe,2016,93,"                      The film could be thought of as an elegy in the form of letters sent from the cities that housed [Stefan Zweig] in America, from Buenos Aires to New York, until his final retreat in Brazil. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
Ten Thousand Saints,2015,58,"                      A bit of a ""paint by numbers"" exercise that never manages to fully engage.                  "
Sicario,2015,92,"                      Taylor Sheridan has written some of the most underappreciated crime movies of the 21st Century, a run that kicked off with this film.                  "

Samba,2014,61,                      Another winning turn from Omar Sy is reason enough to enjoy this optimistic comedy/drama.                  
The Shelter,2015,100,"                      It's a film full of questions and not very many clear answers, but it's very worth seeing as it's a well-crafted directorial debut made by a small team on a small budget which makes the most of it by looking and sounding great.                  "
Viktoria,2014,80,"                      Vitkova, in a beautifully realized debut, has distilled a very personal story into something universal.                  "
Fist Fight,2017,25,                      Why craft a punchline when the camera can run indefinitely while you look for one?                  
Murder on the Orient Express,2017,61,"                      While this take on Murder on the Orient Express is destined to exist as a Sunday afternoon matinee picture people will throw on and bask in, there is unmistakable depth and humanity inside the confectionary of its exterior and its big-budget staging.                  "
Timbuktu,2014,98,
The Surprise,2015,88,                      ... has timing that many half-hour sitcom directors would envy... [Full review in Spanish]                  
Allegiant,2016,11,"                      Builds to a finale that feels less like the culmination of three films than a last-minute justification for another sequel in an overlong, unwanted franchise.                  "
All Creatures Big And Small,2015,36,"                      But it is still a solid family film, and definitely worth your time and money if you're a parent and want to do something fun with your children.                  "
True Son,2014,100,"                      ""True Son"" is there to capture why all hope shouldn't be lost and thrives on the excitement of witnessing a new star being born.                  "
Rabbit,2017,86,"                      This film, despite its issues, is not to be missed especially for its atmosphere and performances.                  "
The Independent,2022,33,"                      Whole movie is kind of a shrug, even if you still turn the pages to see what happens.                  "
The End of the Tour,2015,92,                      The film is fascinatingly intellectual and brimming with humanity.                  
Ice Age: Collision Course,2016,18,"                      The familiar voices of Ray Romano, Jesse Tyler Ferguson and Max Greenfield make for some distinct and headstrong characters - a winning formula, if there ever was one.                  "
Bangistan,2015,33,"                      It provides food for thought, but perhaps we're just tired of the same old food. Go the whole hog; give me a happy meal instead.                  "
The Messenger,2015,83,"                      Robert Sheehan has some good moments, and his flashbacks are the most interesting thing, but a directionless narrative lets The Messenger down.                  "
The Great Man,2014,67,                      The Great Man is enjoyable in part because its characters are well-defined without obviously taking the story in one direction or another.                  
Addicted,2014,7,                      Addicted doesn't know how to competently address its issues of shame and guilt without simply reifying that sexual fulfillment is something that ravages unless tightly contained.                  
Cake,2014,49,"                      Cake wants to be edgy and genuine, to expose raw and visceral feelings. But it keeps from mining the most searing dramatic soil because, given the nature of the tragedy which it orbits, confronting them head-on may prove uncomfortable to audiences.                  "
High Strung,2016,75,"                      Arts movie High Strung has a goofy script and a clichd plot, but the dance sequences and musical performances are memorable, ambitious, and highly enjoyable.                  "
Jugni,2016,50,                      I found myself hoping fiercely that the film wouldn't falter in the end. I wasn't disappointed.                  
Virunga,2014,100,"                      Be prepared to shed absolute buckets at the horrors. But, it isn't entirely bleak though, as the real message here is the lengths that people will go to in order to save a species.                  "
Night Will Fall,2014,100,                      A chilling and important documentary about the horrors of the Nazi death camps in WWII...                  
E-Team,2014,82,                      There's a good documentary to be made about the work these people do; E-Team isn't it.                  
The Frontier,2015,50,"                      The Frontier serves as an excellent showcase for its actors as well as a striking calling card for Shai's directorial chops. However, the flaws in its storytelling and character development do keep it from being as great a film as it could have been.                  "
Censored Voices,2015,90,"                      Censored Voices is fascinating, thought provoking and emotional, though perhaps not as much as it could have been given the subject matter.                  "
Closer to God,2014,53,                      Though the premise of the film is clearly a classic there are some surprises to be had while the doctor plays God.                  
Fort Tilden,2014,88,"                      What begins in the shallow end of the story pool ends in the deep end, showing empathy for characters who, themselves, have little of that virtue.                  "
Happiness,2013,83,"                      The world of Happiness is a bit off-kilter, which creates distance between you and the film. But if you look closer, you might get a glimpse of your own pathetic desires and contradictions.                  "
Torn,2013,90,"                      Directed by Jeremiah Birnbaum, Torn dissects the tenacity with which the media can jump on a story, manipulating the facts to suit a certain narrative, and by doing so, exposing buried prejudices in ourselves.                  "
Finders Keepers,2015,98,                      Its focus on the humanity underneath the absurdity keeps it from being an historical footnote.                  
Unforgettable,2017,28,                      [Unforgettable] hits all the right notes and never stops to make excuses for itself.                  
37,2016,22,"                      37 is disturbing for its reported accuracy surrounding the actual death of Genovese, but Grasten doesn't present an effective narrative. It's a slow burn, leading up to a third act that is muffled and lacks power.                  "
The White Haired Witch of Lunar Kingdom,2014,13,"                      Effective direction from Jacob Leung, but the great romance gets lost in a plot thick with politics...                  "
Stations of the Cross,2014,93,                      A strikingly directed and superbly acted drama that’s by turns disturbing and genuinely moving.                  
Romeo and Juliet,2014,71,"                      Directed by David Leveaux, this film of the stage show is clunky, with sudden close-ups that seem out of place.                  "
Extinction,2015,18,"                      On paper it sounds quite good and... I had high expectations for it, something that surely has influenced how it ended up being such a huge disappointment. [Full Review in Spanish]                  "
Hondros,2017,100,"                      May we all celebrate the work that he, and others like him, undertake for our collective benefit.                  "
Despicable Me 3,2017,59,"                      Even though the story is fairly convoluted, it's worth taking your kids to see. There are laughs abounding.                  "
Rise of the Legend,2014,63,                      Too many flashbacks and repetitive fight scenes almost overpower Eddie Peng's fine performance.                  
"Black Coal, Thin Ice",2014,96,"                      Diao's China, the Beijing Olympics still 4 years away, is still very much provincial (""Who brought in a horse in my apartment?""), yet fast changing and cold-hearted. The film announces the arrival of another major auteur in Chinese cinema.                  "
Sing,2016,71,                      It possesses a cheery disposition that's downright infectious.                  
The Widowmaker,2015,100,"                      Over six hundred thousand Americans die of heart attacks each year, more than from all forms of cancer combined.                  "
Sweet Home,2015,80,"                      It's nothing exciting, but it is entertaining enough to pass the time. [Full Review in Spanish]                  "
Boundaries,2016,80,"                      Boundaries doesn't have anything new to add, but for those craving some political science and economics in their entertainment, this film is catnip. The star power of thinking-man goddess Emily VanCamp doesn't hurt.                  "
1971,2014,97,"                      The film is entertaining; there are many small moments of humor to be found in the tense situations, and audiences are satisfied to see the FBI's activities exposed for what they were.                  "
Vice,2015,4,"                      The acting ranges from amateurish (Childers) to bored (Willis, smirk barely disguising his lack of interest), the script gets bogged down in lumpy exposition, and the action is unexciting.                  "
Black Widow,2021,79,                      Harbour’s Alexi stands out among this talented group                  
Ma ma,2015,25,"                      Penélope Cruz is luminous and with the force of her charisma holds the film together as the suffering madonna, unbelievably cheerful and selfless throughout her protracted ordeal.                  "
Chocolate City,2015,60,"                      As opposed to the sharp cinematography and direction of Steven Soderbergh and his disciple Gregory Jacobs, Chocolate City goes for more intimately hazy and lingering POV shots.                  "
Inconceivable,2017,36,"                      Baker was given only fifteen days to shoot, [...] so it’s a miracle we have such an entertaining film at all, artistry be damned. At the end of the day, if the only significant valid complaint is a bad wig, that’s not too shabby for a first outing.                  "
The Pirates,2014,57,                      Epic martial arts tale is entertaining but violent.                  
Drug Lord: The Legend of Shorty,2014,63,"                      ... turns out to be uneven and incomplete (with some graphic violence to illustrate its points), but compelling as it tries to separate fact from rumor amid a large-scale manhunt.                  "
The Congressman,2016,33,                      So-so political drama has lots of strong language.                  
Mediterranea,2015,90,"                      A destabilizing operation operates raw, despite its latent violence as a continuum in which images, sequences and ellipses occur fluidly, deftly staggered, linked, linked, without ever splicing. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
Pound of Flesh,2015,14,"                      Its script is terrible, its production values are weak, and there is a lackadaisical streak running through the film so overt that it borders on having contempt for its audience. Despite this, I enjoyed myself.                  "
The Great Museum,2014,67,"                      The Great Museum is a beautiful love letter to obsession and eccentricity, the love is given and received in equal measure.                  "
Not My Type,2014,83,                      Above its faults rises yet another distressing and noteworthy performance from Emilie Dequenne.                  
Outlaws and Angels,2016,29,"                      ""The innocence or the darkness, which are we?"" Josiah asks; Outlaws and Angels goes too heavy on the latter, to its own detriment.                  "
Still Life,2014,63,"                      Ultimately, though, the stifling bleakness and an improbable ending add up to a disappointing film.                  "
Fan,2016,80,                      What a pleasure to watch Shah Rukh Khan shrug off every quirk his admirers have drooled over for 27 years and sink his teeth into a role.                  
The Intruders,2015,17,"                      Formulaic can be fun but things are downright sleepy until the big reveal, which is mostly silly, not scary.                  "
Lez Bomb,2018,89,"                      Misunderstandings snowball into comedy gold, aided by a stellar supporting cast.                  "
Take Me to the River,2014,75,                      'Take Me to the River' has its detractions but not enough to derail the project.                  
Gueros,2014,93,"                      Brilliant use of black and white cinematography to showcase social differences, social-political commentary with a simple yet fascinating story.                  "
Race,2016,63,"                      Just when I was beginning to lose hope when it comes to Hollywood's disturbing penchant for seeing black characters as victims, Race comes along.                  "
Assassination,2015,83,"                      Assassination is a meticulously crafted film crammed with diverse elements, including sumptuously detailed set design, goofy slapstick humour, and even a meet cute. Best of all, there's a kickass heroine.                  "
Ithaca,2015,22,"                      Sweet and nice enough to support if you like idealistic, albeit meandering WWII stories, or want to live inside a Rockwell painting for a while.                  "
Thor: Ragnarok,2017,93,                      Those not interested in continuity or source material won’t have any problems with “Thor: Ragnarok”.                  
The Whole Truth,2016,34,"                      This courtroom mystery is more of a procedural puzzle than a realistic legal drama - indeed, one can imagine Agatha Christie coming up with the basic plot. It isn't exactly a nailbiter, but the story's twists are enjoyably engaging.                  "
Embers,2015,83,"                      It's an odd film, with a lot of intensity and three interesting performances, but somewhat dull or blunted in its outlook and impact.                  "
Weekend of a Champion,2013,73,"                      A good weekend's work by everyone; including the sharp director, Frank Simon.                  "
Time Out of Mind,2014,80,"                      If ever a film could be described as having 'a soul', this would be the one. Time Out Of Mind is masterful.                  "
The Decent One,2014,68,                      The Decent One scratches the surfaces of a man without much of a personality who did terrible things. It comes as no great shock to discover there isn't really anything underneath.                  
The Assassin,2015,80,"                      The high volume of posturing and portending weighs down ""The Assassin"" and will test your patience.                   "
Misunderstood,2014,80,"                      Asia Argento takes full advantage of this original tale of children's psychology, [Full review in Spanish]                  "
That Demon Within,2014,47,"                      Flawed though it may be, with many concepts unfulfilled and not as ""dark and mysterious"" as Lam intended it to be, That Demon Within is a visually impressive film with elaborate action scenes that will satisfy most fans of the genre                  "
Potato Dreams of America,2021,91,"                      Hurley’s script is quite funny, especially in the first act, where Potato and Lena do their best to tolerate those who are intolerable among them.                   "
The Free World,2016,50,                      First-time writer-director Jason Lew is heavy handed with his use of symbolism... But the two stars somehow make their overwrought characters work - and earn our sympathy to boot.                  
Burn Country,2016,60,"                      Despite some atmospheric touches, the film doesn't offer much meaningful insight into the struggle of a man trying desperately to assimilate into a new culture.                  "
We Are Still Here,2015,95,"                      We Are Still Here delivers on the scares while showing a story of loss. It's effective and works on many levels, not the least of which being how it homages scary movies of the 1970s.                  "
The Lighthouse,2016,71,                      Crow shows an ability to quickly right his ship anytime things start to take on too much water.                  
The Look of Silence,2014,96,"                      Oppenheimer has developed another important piece of cinema that is as illuminating as it is shocking. I can’t tell you how many times I sat, mouth open and covered by my hand, in utter silence, overwhelmed by what I was seeing.                  "
Moana,2016,95,"                      Moana proves so visually stunning that all other qualities recede, and the audience beams afterward in awe of its sheer beauty.                  "
Journey to the West,2014,94,"                      Mutates from touching, to funny, to downright violent in mere seconds.                  "
Mechanic: Resurrection,2016,30,                      The plot was really convoluted.                  
Spiral,2014,50,                      ...a misguided and thoroughly pointless piece of work.                  
Ghosts,2014,28,"                      Flounders with uncertainty of direction as it touches on socio-economic depression, demons, vengeance, race and culture but never fleshes anything out. Everything feels like an after-thought as opposed to being cohesively constructed and interlaced.                  "
The Incident,2014,83,"                      A fantastic, intriguing and unsettling film. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
The Night Before,2015,69,                      A raunchy party movie that lacks the requisite laughs or heart to make it a holiday classic                  
Free to Run,2016,57,"                      Some legs of the journey are detours, and the film can feel overlong and diffuse, but as a capsule history it offers revelatory insights, particularly in its emphasis on the role of distance running in the women's movement.                  "
Correspondence,2016,14,                      ... suspicions are confirmed and all mystery disappears. [Full review in Spanish]                  
Pilgrimage,2017,68,"                      Made with a small budget and shot in thirty days, “Pilgrimage” sleekly maneuvers through its limitations instead of succumbing to them.                  "
Nerve,2016,67,                      By the time the story reaches its climax practically all logic is out the window.                   
American Made,2017,85,"                      ""American Made"" is southern-fried Scorsese Lite, a gumbo of decadent deviance masking over a sharp spice of potentially fatal risks.                  "
Don Verdean,2015,29,                      Rockwell is an inexplicable blank in the middle of what I can only assume was meant to be an absurd comedy.                  
Entanglement,2017,61,"                      Tries to be a drama about mental health, a missing-person mystery and a twee romantic comedy at the same time. It succeeds at none of it.                  "
Dior and I,2014,84,                      The potential for tension between Simons and his new colleagues makes Dior And I compelling.                  
Dishkiyaoon,2014,0,                      Dishkiyaoon confounds on a very basic technical level.                  
Line of Duty,2019,56,                      A diverting way to pass 98 minutes but upon reflection there are better ways to spend your (real) time.                  
Akron,2015,50,"                      We see some beautiful people in a dreary town doing a lot of acting, but without actually immersing us in any semblance of authenticity.                  "
Sing Street,2016,95,"                      The real surprises may be Carney’s collection of acting unknowns who make up the band. Their camaraderie is infectious, and watching them create music and find fulfillment gets to the true heart of “Sing Street”.                  "
Belgica,2016,53,                      Belgica didn't do much for me.                  
The Visitor,2014,90,"                      While newcomers like Sleiman and Gurira are impressive, it's the veterans Abbass (Paradise Now) and Jenkins (TV's Six Feet Under) who deserve the plaudits.                  "
Road,2014,82,"                      Filmed with incredible depth and zip by filmmakers Hewitt and Lavery, Road is an earnest, realistic acknowledgement of the sport, showing the impacts of the brothers' love for the sport.                  "
All Is Well,2015,10,                      ... just another formulaic comedy.                  
Aardvark,2017,12,                      Shoaf builds to an odd crescendo and then mocks his audience for finally taking the leap with him. It's an audacious move that brings the third act to a grinding halt and really had me wondering what the director was attempting to accomplish.                  
Nas: Time Is Illmatic,2014,98,"                      Parker and One9 deserve huge credit for treating their subject with suitable, but unusual, respect and reverence.                  "
Aimy in a Cage,2015,50,                      Aimy in a Cage is an annoying frenzy of a film that will push your patience further than any film should.                  
Whiskey Tango Foxtrot,2016,68,"                      WTF also describes my reaction to the way the film swings between comedy and warfare. That said, the film grows on you...                  "
Captain Fantastic,2016,83,                      Matt Ross’s story of this off-the-grid family clashing with the outside world naturally has its funny moments. But it’s also a film filled with genuine feeling.                  
Khoobsurat,2014,80,"                      For the most part, this delightfully roguish romance tickles everything fun-loving inside you.                  "
The Fool,2014,93,"                      Bykov's script and direction are flawless in this sequence, as with each passing moment the severity of the situation ramps up the intensity.                  "
Containment,2015,92,"                      I found myself most captivated by Sheila Reid whose performance is simultaneously vulnerable, self-assured and immensely satisfying.                  "
Eternity,2016,80,"                      An imperfect piece, but that works on its ultimate idea of conveying the vision of its author about Humanity and putting it in value within his cinematography. [Full Review in Spanish]                  "
The Visit,2015,68,"                      While Shyamalan doesn’t reinvent the wheel with “The Visit”, he does show the creative flourishes that made him a respected name and overnight success in the horror-thriller genre.                  "
Legend,2015,61,"                      Hardy's individual performances are excellent, quite predictably, though his characters are two-dimensional at best.                  "
Station to Station,2014,71,"                      It's impossible to engage with this glib film, which feels like a very long mobile-phone advert.                  "
Fall,2014,40,"                      Throughout the entirety of ""Fall,"" Murphy unassumingly serves notice that proficient character actors we often take for granted really shouldn't be.                  "
Regarding Susan Sontag,2014,86,"                      While it would be easy to create a sterilized portrait of the accomplished intellectual, Kates refrains from doing so.                  "
West Side Story,2021,91,"                      ""There’s no way to get around the fact that Spielberg’s West Side Story is a modern masterpiece. In a year chock full of live-action musicals, this one rises above the rest.""                  "
Kill Me Please,2015,65,"                      There are chunks that work beautifully, images that may haunt me for a long time, but they never quite cohere into a formidable piece.                  "
Only the Dead,2015,89,                      The footage is incredible -- both in terms of what it shows and the danger Ware puts himself through to get it -- and permits none of the censorship we're accustomed to.                  
Backtrace,2018,8,"                      Backtrace is a bare-bones action movie. It follows the beat-by-beat expectations of movies in the genre, squandering the intriguing potential of a plot about an experimental drug.                  "
Night Owls,2015,100,"                      A satisfying entry into the one crazy night genre that never leaves the house, ""Night Owls"" is one worth staying up for.                  "
Lost in the Sun,2015,20,"                      At every minute in this film, you know where it's going, because nothing that happens in any of the 130 minutes of this film works at all if the movie doesn't get there.                  "
Hollow,2014,20,"                      Whilst Axelgaard as a director could be one to watch, in this instance he's regrettably hamstrung by the tired trappings of the found footage cycle, into which he is unable to breathe fresh air.                  "
Bad Girl,2016,60,"                      Like Amy's gleaming new home, which is transformed from a sanctuary into a trap, the film twists perceptions of adolescent camaraderie, attraction, and family's grip, with just enough shocks to allay the familiar conclusion.                  "
Eva Hesse,2016,81,                      Marcie Begleiter’s stolid and engaging Eva Hesse provides an introduction to her meteoric life and career.                    
The Diabolical,2015,40,"                      An utterly contrived reveal leads to everything going completely mental, as the film tries desperately to be a dozen different things at once.                  "
Knock Knock,2015,37,"                      Roth's lowest-common-denominator approach reduces a primal, campy idea into nothing more than a dull homage to an exploitation flick.                  "
Cars 3,2017,69,"                      Cars 3 has a well-worn, delivers-what's-expected quality that lacks vitality.                  "
In a Valley of Violence,2016,77,"                      West and company (wisely) never take their movie too seriously. Even when it’s moving by the numbers, it remains quirky enough to feel slightly off-center.                  "
Bank Chor,2017,11,"                      The film, on its part, adheres to no particular generic rules, flitting back and forth between flippant and intense in the hope of hitting its straps. It never does.                  "
The Grudge,2020,20,                      It ends up being an aggressively middle of the road movie and the kind we’ve come to expect in early January.                  
Mommy,2014,88,"                      ...for all of Steve's livewire energy, the hero of Mommy is never in doubt. Anne Dorval is simply amazing as the indomitable Die...                  "
Same River Twice,2013,68, 
Jem and the Holograms,2015,22,                      Jem is honest enough in its aims that the sacrilegious divergence from the original material can almost be forgiven.                  
Along Came the Devil,2018,38,                      We get the usual array of badly timed ''BOO!'' moments and gross-out bits that have been seen in dozens of ''Exorcist'' riffs over the years.                  
Condemned,2015,25,"                      Like an ensemble Robert Altman piece by way of Eli Roth, ""Condemned"" compellingly immerses the viewer in an unthinkably grimy, harrowing way of life, then drags one and all into a figurative netherworld where the only means of escape is very likely death.                  "
Anguish,2015,62,"                      Within a matter of hours, Anguish went from an ambiguous horror title to one of my top horror films of the year.                  "
Under Milk Wood,2015,35,"                      In short: Under Milk Wood is a mess. At length: It is tone-deaf, sputtering on the fumes of Thomas's renown, hoping to make a proud entry into the author's canon.                  "
Ricki and the Flash,2015,64,                      Demme is unrivalled at filming bands at play—and at noticing the folks who listen and dance along—and Streep’s part is worthy of her formidable gifts.                  
Bjork: Biophilia Live,2014,77,                      Björk's concert film is a remarkable document of a remarkable artist still impossible to pigeonhole...                  
State Like Sleep,2018,37,                      There's a curiously inert and lifeless feel to this world.                  
Barbershop: The Next Cut,2016,90,"                      The Next Cut is a comedy with dramatic heft or a drama with solid comedy, depending on how you look at it. Either way, it more than justifies returning to the barbershop.                  "
The Girl on the Train,2016,44,"                      Apart from the film's acting, fans of the source material should ignore the adaptation and preserve their imagination's picture of Hawkins' novel.                  "
Soul Boys of the Western World,2014,72,"                      This has the quality of an illustrated oral history, though the incessant nostalgia and revisionist history are exhausting.                  "
Allied,2016,60,"                      Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard bring elegant performances to an intelligent and stylish picture, which gradually reveals a profound emotional resonance under its outward restraint.                  "
Heaven on Earth,2015,40,                      it all comes off with the rising and emotional sense of achievement that was so heart-warming in the original                  
Cinderella,2013,83,"                      There are moments of CGI animal nonsense that seem to exist completely separate from the live-action beauty Branagh has created, and that awkward juxtaposition leaves the entire film feeling uneven, at times admirable, and at others condemnable.                  "
Cut Off,2018,100,"                      Brutal serial killer thriller from a horror director, thriller novelist and forensic consultant. Couple of minor issues with the writing, but tension and performances all excellent.                  "
Blood Father,2016,89,"                      Finds a way to channel Gibson's fury, rounding up a satisfactory and effective film, and without a doubt, the redemption he needed. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
Brothers,2015,43,                      Brothers is a film that plays emotional rope-a-dope with its audience.                  
Fire at Sea,2016,95,"                      As if one of Wender's angels descended to observe as closely as possible, Rosi presents his observations without commentary or context.                  "
The Dark Stranger,2015,20,"                      One of the rare horror movies that would probably work better if the horror elements were extracted, leaving just the underlying family drama to speak for itself.                  "
Creep 2,2017,100,"                      Just how Creep 2 picks up the story, with Girls actress Desiree Akhavan front and center as a hopeful YouTube star, is even more of a hoot.                  "
Art and Craft,2014,91,                      Art and Craft provides a fascinating portrait of Landis' internal process and justification for what seem to be random acts of philanthropy.                  
Girlhood,2014,96,"                      Girlhood is vital, a reminder that there is so much more to be said, so much more beauty and complexity to be explored, in the coming-of-age story.                  "
The Olive Tree,2016,88,"                      A clean, original storyline, good acting, a strong visual sense of the Spanish countryside all combine to make The Olive Tree a superb experience.                  "
The Martian,2015,91,"                      This entertaining mixture of striking visuals and patient, methodical narrative has little in common with Scott’s past sci-fi experiences.                  "
Taxi,2015,96,"                      “Taxi” always kept my attention, and it had me absorbing every encounter to find how they fit with Panahi’s vision.                   "
Party Girl,2014,73,"                      Angélique is an instant, screen-grabbing star, and her family and friends are relaxed and captivating in their supporting roles as themselves.                  "
Happy Hour,2015,38,                      never fleshes any of its characters out beyond bare simplicity                  
Monkey Kingdom,2015,93,"                      Devotees of more objective Nature documentaries will suffer through a questionable soundtrack and a few moments of overemphasized slapstick, but the world represented here is undeniably stunning on a visual level, and certainly dramatic on its own terms.                  "
The Dig,2021,88,"                      It’s really something when a film is not too concerned with the aesthetic but will find the beauty in discovery of one’s own. The Dig is a good picture, wonderfully acted (Ralph Fiennes is tremendous here), and an engrossing reimagining.                  "
One More Time,2015,53,"                      In a perfect role that blends Walken-ese eccentricities with the heart of family, [Christopher] Walken shines as Paul Lombard. This is deadpan comedic Walken-ese at its best.                  "
Dragon Blade,2015,35,"                      ...it would be misleading (if gracious) to focus only on Dragon Blade's handful of redeeming aspects. In total, it's a ridiculous drag of a movie...                  "
Merchants of Doubt,2014,86,"                      A documentary about this kind of insidious industry, so-called experts hired to create public uncertainty about science topics, underscores a flaw in modern news reporting that more people need to know about.                  "

Badlapur,2015,92,"                      This is no mindless gore-fest, as the director and actors do a good job of drawing you into their heads - no matter how warped or twisted.                  "
Dishoom,2016,50,"                      Dishoom is a sporadically engaging, intermittently funny, yet always insubstantial film.                  "

Youth in Oregon,2016,45,                      Youth in Oregon presents euthenasia as it might actually be faced in real life; a dramatic representation of how one might approach the issue as an active participant.                  
Miss Hokusai,2015,93,                      Miss Hokusai is a highly entertaining film that excels both artistically and in terms of story.                  
The BFG,2016,74,"                      “The BFG” is a delightfully heartwarming movie that may push away those looking to have their senses set ablaze by nonstop action and rampant silliness. But for those looking for an intelligent and engaging experience, “The BFG” more than delivers.                  "

The Forgiven,2021,68,                      …McDonagh’s unwillingness to characterise the Moroccan characters beyond surly servants and mute witnesses feels very old-fashioned and insensitive…                  
Stuck,2017,52,                      The performers attack the tunes with vigor and bounce off of each other agreeably.                  
Let Me Make You a Martyr,2016,60,"                      [A] restless, flashy and ultimately unpleasant bore, one that spends more time finding its voice than telling a coherent, engaging story.                  "
Heidi,2015,100,                      Animated take on a classic tale is full of positivity.                  
Daisy Winters,2017,60,"                      This drama is under-directed to the point of being alternately lifeless and awkward, but the main character has an appealing spunkiness that sometimes elevates the film.                  "
The Other Side of the Door,2016,36,                      Bound to be forgotten by those who can get through its 96-minute runtime without walking out of the theater or shutting it off at home.

Digging for Fire,2015,64,                      Digging for Fire is Swanberg's best film to date. I enjoyed finding what's buried beneath his style.                  
Brain on Fire,2016,13,"                      Brain on Fire is like a virus itself, trying to infect an otherwise interest story with its own mediocre movie clichés.                  "
By the Sea,2015,35,                      This movie was terrible.                  
The Last Witness,2018,29,                      The Last Witness provides an intriguing slice of history ... but more nuance and detail in the execution and story would have offered the audience far greater satisfaction.                  
Hello Again,2017,29,"                      Ten vignettes deal with love and lust. But most of them end up a bust. Still, Audra is a real standout. Her moon song bit deserves a shout!                  "
The Warning,2018,50,                      Atmospheric Spanish thriller about a man who recognises a pattern in gun-crimes at a particular location; and a boy who is warned he will die on his tenth birthday.                  
Ghosthunters: On Icy Trails,2015,13,                      Ghostly adventure has more mental health jokes than scares.                  
Tango Negro: The African Roots of Tango,2013,80,"                      Distinctively associated with Argentina, and distinctively white, the world-famous tango is here returned to its rightful place and shared roots.                  "
Irrational Man,2015,46,                       “Irrational Man” comes across as paper-thin.                  
Elle,2016,91,                      Verhoeven is the master of this domain. Long may he reign.

Hunter Gatherer,2016,96,"                      I am glad to have seen this, if only to witness Andre Royo once again prove his incredible range as an actor.                  "
Power Rangers,2017,51,"                      It is great to say that while Power Rangers is no cinematic masterpiece, it is a fine start to a franchise that has been resurrected and thrown back into the limelight.                   "
The Two of Us,2014,94,"                      There’s so little going on in The Two of Us that one has to begin thinking of it as an idyll-fable, which has never been my idea of a good time.                  "
My All-American,2015,31,"                      My All American is precisely that - a snow cone. Sweet, pleasant tasting, but ultimately cold and lacking in substance.                  "
American Honey,2016,79,                      Arnold's elegiac and naked picture functions as a road adventure born of Dickens and Kerouac.                  
Gringo,2018,40,"                      Double-crosses and twists saturate the material, leaving Gringo with a modest degree of unpredictability that keeps the viewer guessing, albeit with few moments of levity or any genuine investment in the characters.                  "
Bokeh,2017,43,"                      Charming stars and pleasant scenery are all well and good, but can only carry Bokeh so far.                  "
The Lady in the Van,2015,89,                      The Lady in the Van shows us that respect and kindness is always the right way to go.                  
Revolt,2017,60,"                      Any fan of the genre will probably suffer a constant deja-vu. Still, it's interesting enough to remain watchable.                  "
Puerto Ricans in Paris,2015,33,"                      No harm, no foul. It didn't go in the direction I thought it would, it wasn't as funny as I wanted it to be. But I'm not angry about it.                  "
Dark Matter,2014,40, 
Body,2015,42,                      It's one of those films where its blatant attempts at being egregious wind up making it heinous for all the wrong reasons.                  
The Trust,2016,63,"                      Man cannot live on Nicolas Cage alone, however - take him out of the proceedings and The Trust proves to be a by-the-numbers bank job with a disappointing conclusion.                  "
Cordelia,2019,73,"                      Unfortunately, the final act does not deliver in the way it should. The lead up is great, but it does not provide the impact that it should. After a well constructed first hour, things feel rushed in the final thirty minutes.                   "
Freetown,2015,50,                      I was completely engrossed in the journey.                  
Reset,2015,20,                      An unpleasant exercise in self-indulgence directed and written by Paul Bojack.                  
Mountains May Depart,2015,90,"                      Jia foresees this rootlessness happening for the next generation of Chinese. It's like predisposed collective melancholy that will hit China like tidal waves in the near future. Poignant and sad, Mountains is another great film from the modern master.                  "
Godzilla: King of the Monsters,2019,42,"                      Michael Dougherty has delivered a Godzilla movie that is unquestionably action-heavy, probably too much for those with no affection for the classic creature-features.                  "
Lion,2016,84,"                      Aside from one slightly underserved relationship and the film drifting a tad in the second half, “Lion” eloquently handles this incredible multi-layered story. Patel’s leading man star has never shown brighter.                  "
Awake: The Life of Yogananda,2014,64,"                      After a while, all this serenity becomes soporific. It's one for the already enlightened.                  "
Weightless,2017,44,                      A story whose predictability doesn't make the experience less exciting. [Full review in Spanish]                  
Elephant Song,2014,60,"                      Essentially a two-hander broken up with flashbacks, but director Charles Biname skilfully builds drama and tension throughout. It's a shame that there is no payoff before the end credits roll.                  "
Jungle,2017,61,"                      ...consistently elevated by Radcliffe's eye-opening, completely convincing performance.                  "
Blood Money,2017,50,"                      Another bad Cusack action melodrama, more all-black outfits, jet-black dyed hair and black headware -- not even Netflixale.                  "
My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2,2016,27,"                      There's not an ounce of cynicism here, and I think audiences might respond to the sweet open heartedness of Vardalos and company, but there isn't a lot of originality here either.                  "
Amnesia,2015,77,                      Amnesia is a very passive piece. The film legitimately expresses deep revulsion for fascism.                  
Snowden,2016,61,"                      Stone brings to light that our disturbed and anxious feelings about cyber-scrutiny are not paranoia, because that word suggests the menace isn't real.                   "
Ashby,2015,52,                      Ashby has occasional heartwarming moments but isn't well-rounded enough to understand its own journey.                  
Love,2015,40,"                      Beds, paintings, hallways, parks, bridges, windows, and cafes slip in and out. What is constant is the characters and their search for an honest connection.                  "
400 Days,2015,22,"                      The film is a solid enough venture, and although it could have explored the characters' psyche more thoroughly, the fact that the ending is open-ended and leaves everything to the imagination serves the film well.                  "
Pandemic,2016,56,"                      I thought it was all right for what it was, I'm not a huge fan of this type of film. I'm not really a huge fan of like teen films either.                  "
Autumn Lights,2016,14,"                      What remains are the bones of a decent genre flick, with the aspirations of a Nicolas Winding Refn film. Perhaps Aulakh will get there one day, but there are several kinks to smooth first.                  "
Fish Story,2013,100,"                      I love this movie. It's such an easy watch, even though it's a nonlinear story that spans multiple generations...                  "
Dead Awake,2016,11,"                      Dead Awake is slight but scary, simple but tough and, at times, crawlingly creepy. Fear your bed.                  "
Arrivals,2016,57,"                      The film is well-intentioned on all fronts, but director Peter Hutchings never quite breaks out of a filmmaking approach that feels quite bland and pedestrian.                  "
Rhino,2021,71,"                      Unfortunately, he [director Oleh Sentsov] never found the perfect formula to make the life of his character cinematically noteworthy.                  "
Paulina,2015,89,"                      Paulina, the character of Dolores Fonzi, deserves the attention and not the judgment of the viewer. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
Kingdom of Shadows,2015,79,"                      Kingdom of Shadows may have worked better as a direct interview format because, with three stories taking up most of the film, it doesn't quite come together and because of this, it lacks the kind of meaningful impact a film like this could have had.                  "
We Are Your Friends,2015,39,                      Assures that fighting uncertainty with action is the closest thing there is to hope.                  
Standing Tall,2015,81,"                      Featuring a warm performance from the illustrious Catherine Deneuve, Standing Tall is Emmanuelle Bercot's most emotionally sincere film to date, though isn't too far removed from most standard social issue dramas.                  "
From the Land of the Moon,2016,32,                      From the Land of the Moon is not without merit -Cotillard's expressive face is compulsively watchable- but be prepared for some significant suspension of disbelief.                  
Sonic the Hedgehog,2020,63,                      When “Sonic the Hedgehog” keeps its focus on the light-hearted charm of its titular lead character and on exploring the theme of friendship it makes for a pretty good time.                  
The Choice,2016,11,                      If you enjoy being manipulated and cry easily you make (or may not) enjoy the movie. That choice is yours.                  
Killing Kennedy,2013,56,"                      Might just be a little too sober. At times, it's almost as unbelievable as the throw-everything-against-the-wall story that Oliver Stone tells in JFK.                  "
6 Years,2015,69,                      Fidell's tone and direction keep the film steady and the characters relatable.                  
The Nice Guys,2016,91,"                      Abundant with the same type of caustic sarcasm that made Black’s “Kiss Kiss Bang Bang” an underappreciated, yet cult favorite, “The Nice Guys” is smarter than it has to be and in retrospect, like all great crime thrillers, it is a relatively simple story.                  "
Wild City,2015,50,"                      While the movie boasts visceral fight scenes, the storyline is so unbelievable, it's hard to connect with the characters.                  "
Puli,2015,0,"                      Weak script, poor characterization and bad editing makes 'Puli' a big disappointment.                  "
Even Mice Belong in Heaven,2021,100,"                      ... A thoughtful, comforting tale for children.                  "
Clowntergeist,2017,17,"                      The acting is okay. The interactions between Emma and her best friend Heather (Monica Baker) aren't totally cringe-worthy and occasionally, sometimes accidentally, charming.                  "
Son of Saul,2015,96,"                      A difficult, harrowing, and exhausting film to endure – claustrophobic and psychological. But it’s also an intimate and gripping experience and an extraordinary feature film debut from László Nemes.                  "
Lost in Florence,2017,14,"                      Between its narrative clichs and flat characters, the film doesn't provide much incentive to care whether the lost protagonist finds himself.                  "
Malignant,2021,76,"                      This is horror cinema produced with a sense of reckless, gleeful abandon, and if you fail to gel with its style and sensibilities, be certain it is not the film; it’s you.                  "
Terminal,2018,20,                      Terminal is fuelled by Robbie’s central performance but even that can’t stop it going completely off the rails as it reaches its final destination.                  
Cop Car,2015,82,                      The story’s intensity boils to what seems like a satisfying crescendo only to hit us with a new set of stakes and then leave us on an emotional edge.                   
Turkey Shoot,2014,20,"                      What should be a rollicking bullet train of big screen excess is instead an amateurish, borderline incoherent actioner starring Dominic Purcell, whose dead eyes and stiff physicality is perhaps the most telling aspect of this bumbling reheat.                  "
Sparrows,2015,83,                      In spite of its artfully slow pace Sparrows is bustling with clich.                  
Love Sonia,2018,74,                      This is a bracing and unsettling movie that never pulls a punch in depicting the horror of sexual slavery.                  
Results,2015,85,"                      The stuff of good, classic drama, and in the hands of Bujalski, it all comes off brilliantly.                  "

Warriors,2015,100,"                      With a story as enchanting, life-affirming and soulful as it is unusual, first time director Barney Douglas brings the exploits of the first ever Maasai cricket team to life.                  "
Labyrinth of Lies,2014,82,"                      Being based on a true story, this respectful and studious re-creation of what became a landmark case in the German courts rarely puts a foot wrong.                  "
The Girl in the Photographs,2015,17,                      Nothing actually happens in the movie... it makes no sense and there's no purpose to it.                  
Drift,2015,32,"                      The surfing scenes are exhilarating, the waves more terrifying than anything Eli Roth or James Wan could come up with.                  "
Stephanie,2017,33,                      It tries to put too much information into the times and it just feels misleading.                  
Only the Brave,2017,87,"                      All of this relationship building and character development fuels the final act which, despite some predictable narrative setup, has a profound dramatic kick                  "

The Handmaiden,2016,96,                      Beautiful images in the frame with a grotesc story about the survival in a context war.  You have to watch it. [Full review in Spanish]                  
Exposed,2016,8,"                      A truly unpleasant and unfulfilling watch in every way possible. Aiming for somewhere between the sacred and profane, it lands fully in the latter camp.                  "
The Honor Farm,2017,67,"                      It's like overhearing a 17-year-old rail on about the complexities of life, having read an introductory book on philosophy but never ventured out of his suburb.                  "
UNindian,2015,67,                      The speedster's fans won't be disappointed for sure.                  
Suburra,2015,91,"                      Sollima pulls this together into a slick, polished whole, marked by an energy and focus that allows him to travel through Suburra's various intersecting threads of exploitation, dominance and moral train-wrecks.                  "
Hired Gun,2016,50,                      The players' sheer love of music shines through everything.                  
The Innocents,2021,96,"                      Deeply uncomfortable viewing and as such is bound to elicit some strong opinions. For, despite the title and to quote a certain Queen of Pop, these kids are certainly “not that innocent”.                  "
Panama,2022,8,"                      Nearly shameless in its attempts to re-create the feel of a low-budget 1980s action flick, this un-thrilling movie also forgets to tell a coherent story -- or to make viewers care at all.                   "
Calendar Girl,2020,100,"                      By so thoroughly documenting the instrumental value of the Fashion Calendar, Calendar Girl becomes an engaging historical piece.                  "
Rats,2016,65,                      Often more unsettling than anything you can make up because these little horrors aren't hidden. They're everywhere.                  
Hyena Road,2015,57,                      Paints a picture of the difficulty in fighting a war in very confusing times.                  
Saving Banksy,2017,87,"                      Director Colin M. Day, while dutifully illustrating his subject, fails to have a point of view.                  "
Stray Bullets,2016,75,                      Some nice atmospheric touches are hardly warranted by the film's threadbare substance.                  
Chorus,2015,100,"                      A festering beauty of a film slowly reveals itself in this bleak but uplifting black-and-white study of grief from Quebeçois director François Delisle, an acutely aware portrait of a relationship after the unimaginable.                  "
Get the Girl,2017,13,"                      Glossy, noisy and a little bit dull, Get the Girl is the kind of the film you'd thought they'd stopped making                  "
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,2015,48,"                      Unlike other YA franchises, the basic emotional underpinnings remain vacant in The Maze Runner movies, and the action isn’t good enough to keep our attention.                  "
My Golden Days,2015,90,"                      Utterly believable and charming in its sincerity, Trois Souvenirs puts any bombastic films looking back at one's life to shame.                  "
Hamlet,2014,0,"                      The result is a focused, if at times melodramatic, take on the play's beating heart.                  "
The Shallows,2016,78,"                      “The Shallows” wisely stays true to its central concept. Its hook could easily wear thin if it extended itself too far, but the compact 80 minute running time keeps the tension high and the story moving forward.                  "
Dog Eat Dog,2016,49,                      The whole movie is the textbook definition of 'trying too hard.'                  
A Perfect Man,2015,100,"                      Taut, twisty and riveting, the perfectly sun-tanned noir ironically steals the right parts from its inspirations all while making it fresh.                  "
Light Years,2015,71,"                      Campbell's eye for a real rather than romanticised Britain - motorways, industrial parks, damp forests - is refreshing, yet Light Years fails to take hold until it's almost passed you by.                  "
Firebird,2021,55,"                      One can glean an earnestness from telling this true tale of a romantic entanglement that forced its participants apart, but leaning on historical context does not negate the formulaic execution.                  "
Traffic,2014,92,"                      Apparently, the movie leads one to believe, Washington is fighting the good fight against lawless, amoral peoples.                  "
Te Ata,2016,65,"                      May not be an Oscar contender, but it is well-acted, touching and certainly good enough to deserve this Netflix curtain call.                  "
Green Room,2015,90,"                      Green Room doesn't shy away from the violence and shocks, creating some relentlessly disturbing aesthetics. The cast is stellar and the suspense keeps you on the edge of your seat.                  "
The Dog Lover,2016,20,                      Poorly constructed with grossly misplaced performances and intentions.                  
A Good American,2015,82,"                      Nobody even speaks on behalf of the Trailblazer program, and as predictable as that probably is, it is very unsatisfying.                  "
Miles,2016,64,"                      Miles' storyline also plays alongside his mother's with equal screen-time and yet it's his name that takes the film's title, deceiving us into believing he is some kind of landmark hero. Which he isn't.                  "
The Nightingale,2018,86,                      To watch the film is to accept a merciless confrontation with colonial violence. It's also a step toward healing.                    
Ali and Nino,2016,40,"                      Ali & Nino looks extravagant and beautiful. The romance can be simple, sweet, and lovely at times, but it does fall a bit on the melodramatic side.                  "
The Darkest Minds,2018,15,"                      The film leans into all of the book's worst impulses and, most disappointingly, gives star Amandla Stenberg nothing to do. The FX is on par with other YA films, but the disinterest in exploring this dystopia renders The Darkest Minds hollow.                  "
The Model,2016,71,"                      The Model is one of those films you can't seem to take your eyes off. It had me engaged throughout the ugly, sexy and suspenseful parts.                  "
Life During Wartime,2014,68,                      In the end the film is even more depressing than it was at the start.  [Full review in Spanish]                  
The Lesson,2015,80,"                      The film is an earnest, but artistically and socially limited effort.                  "
City of Joy,2016,100,"                      It's a powerful subject, to be sure, but it's also a big subject-one that encompasses not just issues of women's rights and individual survivor tales but also disturbing geopolitical realities.                  "
A Prayer Before Dawn,2017,92,"                      A punishing, uncompromising prison drama of the highest order...The level of authenticity achieved here is gut-punchingly raw.                  "
The Valet,2022,75,                      It ultimately delivers on the raison d'etre of any rom-com: a satisfactory mix of laughs and love.                  
The Vessel,2016,67,"                      Julio Quintana's The Vessel is a gorgeous, lyrical film about faith that's more interested in questions than in answers.                  "
Urge,2016,0,"                      In his directorial debut, Aaron Kaufman makes a few mistakes, but, overall, offers a decent view of this indulgent lifestyle.                  "
Disorder,2015,73,                      This is the best Schoenaerts has been since Bullhead ... his paranoia consumes all and Wincour's camera swirls... stretching the tension well past bearable up to something kind of exquisite                  
Frankenstein,2015,100,"                      Highly intelligent and deeply wounding, Frankenstein stands as a stark reminder that in these so-called enlightened times, we still haven't made it that far.                  "
"Jia Zhangke, A Guy from Fenyang",2014,83,"                      Salles' low-key documentary reflects nicely on Zhangke's own personal, handheld style. Although an engaging subject matter for those already interested, a little assumed knowledge does prevent its being totally accessible.                  "
Home,2014,52,                      Home is an engaging animated adventure that will appeal far more to those under 8 than their accompanying adults.                  
The Purge: Election Year,2016,55,"                      Whether DeMonaco is visualizing a reflection of our current condition or providing a cautionary tale, his dependency on his high-minded message ultimately drowns out the drama.                  "
Unbreakable,2014,70,"                      Ahead of its time, Unbreakable remains one of the best superhero films of all time. A masterful deconstruction and exploration of the popular comic book genre. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
Life,2014,64,"                      A disappointment considering Corbijn's abilities (particularly when compared to his first and best effort, 2007's Control, another portrait of a tragic artist).                  "
Deep,2017,33,                      Underwater adventures for kids and clubbers with children. [Full review in Spanish]                  
The Postcard Killings,2020,24,"                      At the very least, at the absolute minimum, The Postcard Killings confirms nothing good comes from an art-history degree.                  "
Rough Stuff,2017,80,"                      You may have missed this little Aussie gem of an actioner, as it slid into and out cinemas quickly before landing on digital platforms and DVD/blu-ray; no reason to miss it now, and every reason to take a look.                  "
The Curse of Sleeping Beauty,2016,15,                      It doesn't build up enough mythology to be a pure fantasy; it doesn't do enough with the original Brothers Grimm story to be a pure fairy tale; and there aren't enough scares or enough gore to be pure horror.                  
All Roads Lead to Rome,2015,0,                      A heavy-handed rom/com centered around a Tuscan vacation to escape a stressful situation in NYC.                  
Things to Come,2016,99,"                      A story about the flow of life, the passage of time, generational conflict, and the moment in which middle age isn't suddenly as far as it seemed. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
After,2019,18,"                      This really is a dumpster fire of a movie, so please save your money for something more worthwhile.                  "
White Girl,2016,70,"                      White Girl is a shocking and frenetically paced movie, a nightmarish thrill ride comparable to the Safdie brothers' 2017 Good Time that's equal parts exhausting, exhilarating, and heartbreaking to watch.                  "
Test,2014,82,"                      This entertaining time capsule, set in SF's modern-dance world, makes playful use of that fateful moment when the first blood test for the HIV virus debuted.                  "
My Little Pony: The Movie,2017,47,"                      Given that the story centers on toy pony princesses with magical abilities, My Little Pony: The Movie contains multitudes to unpack.                  "
The Giant,2016,86,"                      Although sometimes dealing in the disability tropes of this subgenre, The Giant stomps new ground in that it encourages us to actively take on the disability perspective of its protagonist.                  "
How to Dance in Ohio,2015,89,"                      Shiva's intimate approach captures moments of triumph and pain along the way, making the struggle of autism accessible to families and communities coping with the affliction.                  "
Florence Foster Jenkins,2016,88,"                      It’s a veritable stew of comedy, drama, and commentary. Yet despite being uneven and a bit stodgy, it’s hard not to be sucked in by its quirkiness.                  "
A Family Affair,2015,73,                      A Family Affair is proof that healing emotional wounds and traumas can often be more impossible than physical injuries.                  
Dark Horse,2015,96,"                      The whole affair has a Caddyshack-esque ""snobs against the slobs"" vibe to it.                  "
Keanu,2016,78,"                      Amid plenty of funny moments where our heroes are confronted with tense, life-threatening situations, Key and Peele always find humorous ways of defusing the tension.                  "
Polar,2019,16,                      Read the synopsis of Polar... you would be mistaken for thinking you were watching John Wick. Polar is the polar opposite to John Wick. In that John Wick is a great film and Polar is a bit of a mess.                  
Long Strange Trip,2017,100,"                      [Long Strange Trip] unravels a tale of sex, drugs, and rock & roll that doesn't come off as cliché, cloying, or hagiographic.                  "
Wiener-Dog,2016,74,"                      For lack of a better term, this is a filmmaker being an a**hole because he can and he doesn’t care.  You will either champion or loathe that supposed brilliance and brashness.                  "
Moby-Dick,2013,83,"                      Huston's Moby Dick, though, is finally not unworthy of its source. While so many adapted films of literary masterpieces are little more than perfunctory plot summaries, the failure of this one owes nothing to oversimplification or stupidity.                  "
Unexpected,2015,66,"                      Never falling into the trap of being predictable or stereotypical, UNEXPECTED is such a lovely, sweet film, that had me smiling the entire time.                  "

The New Man,2016,100,                      Answers are nowhere to be found in this paradoxical documentary. The New Man demystifies parenthood by showing two open-hearted people going through and describing the process.                  
The Here After,2015,85,"                      Von Horn falls into a lot of trappings that make his debut more like a collection of influences than the arrival of a distinct voice in arthouse cinema, but at least he's lifting things from the right people.                  "
Always at The Carlyle,2018,58,"                      Always at the Carlyle is part escapist star gazing, part intersection with the world at large, and a whole lot of fun through and through.                  "
Captain Marvel,2019,79,"                      While I wouldn’t put “Captain Marvel” in the upper echelon of Marvel movies, it does really well at introducing its character and setting her up to be a major player in the MCU.                   "
Avengers: Endgame,2019,94,                      Avengers: Endgame is not just a culmination of the last eleven years of the Marvel Studios cinematic saga but also a celebration of everything people have come to love about these characters.                  
Replicas,2018,11,"                      Even though I did find it strangely entertaining, it’s just too scattered and a little too goofy to get behind it.                  "
Other People,2016,85,"                      Other People is the perfect balance of humor, sentimentality, and emotion. I laughed, I cried, I cheered, and at the end of the film, I stood up with the rest of the crowd.                  "
The Lady in the Car with Glasses and a Gun,2015,80,"                      While we ultimately don't care about the car, the glasses, or the gun, we can't get enough of the lady.                  "
Pulse,2017,86,                      The idea of being a friend is what is at the core of this movie.                  
Prince,2015,71,"                      A confined film that combines sociological cut, family chronicle, urban thriller, romantic drama, fairy tale and the fable. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
Tales of Halloween,2015,77,                      Hearing the sultry Adrienne Barbeau (channeling DJ Stevie Wayne from The Fog) introducing each story while appearing in none of them is the biggest offense among many.                  
Most Likely to Die,2015,33,                      It's very stereotyped and it's very cheesy to me.                  
Sanctuary,2016,100,"                      The movie, rather admirably isn't black and white about the issues it raises.                  "
The Pack,2015,55,"                      The Pack is a savage survival story that goes right for a jugular, whether you're a dog lover or not.                  "
At the End of the Day,2018,100,"                      O'Brien avoids harsh attitudes throughout the even-keeled, gentle spirited film.                  "
Arrebato,2014,96,"                      The director and his collaborators nurse a heroin jones that is evident in nearly every frame, and as the characters constantly seek pleasure, the vanity of that existence, and even of the very act of film making, ends up a death sentence.                  "
Give Me Liberty,2019,89,"                      There is liberty in speed, for sure, but also in the embrace of small, quiet moments. May such freedom be ours for the taking, always.                  "
Delirium,2017,0,"                      There are narrative aspects that are inventive, but unfortunately, the movie overextends its grasp.                  "
Ace the Case,2016,20,"                      This kiddie crime caper promises fun, but delivers clueless disappointment instead.                  "
The Gift,2015,91,"                      It certainly hits some of the normal genre ticks, but you almost sense that it’s doing it to set the audience up in order to pull the rug out from under them later on.                  "
After,2014,8,"                      Gaspersz embeds you with this family's struggles, and almost makes you care about what happens to them all in the end                  "
Otherhood,2019,26,                      A good Netflix film... [has] some of that Sex and the City vibe.                  
The Crucifixion,2017,6,"                      The scenery was stunning and the support acting was wonderful. While the lackluster story and sleepy lead slowed things down, it still made for a moderately entertaining watch.                   "
Woodlawn,2015,73,                      It isn't nearly as compelling as Freetown... but it is a solid effort.                  
The Hunting Ground,2015,93,"                      The Hunting Ground succeeds as a damning portrait of how colleges have allowed sexual assault to go unchecked, valuing their own reputations over the lives of vulnerable students.                  "
Ordinary World,2016,47,                      Ordinary World is unable to tap into the universal themes of being uneasy growing up and accepting responsibility because its main character is just so aloof in everything that he does.                  
Strange Magic,2015,18,                      Takes some simple ideas-beauty is only skin deep and love conquers all-and sprinkles them with fairy dust to create a musical that plays like Moulin Rouge for kids.                  
Meet the Blacks,2016,17,"                      And the sad fact is it's so obnoxiously awful, you'll wish it was actually another Madea Halloween.                  "
The Promise,2017,51,                      Movies like Lawrence of Arabia and Reds had the ability to sweep viewers away with their passion and grandeur. The only sweeping to be found in this case will be by the theater employee tasked with removing spilled popcorn from the auditorium floor.                  
Indignation,2016,82,"                      Glacial pacing aside, this is a solid, quietly rewarding coming of age tale.                  "
Dead Reckoning,2020,17,                      Just a let down in every way from the direction to the cast to the plot.                  
The Birth of a Nation,2016,73,                      From start to finish “Birth” keeps you locked in and focused. Parker never loses the potency of his subject matter.                  
Jason Bourne,2016,54,"                      It is a bit slow out of the gate, but when it gets its footing it falls right in line with the franchise.                  "
Mr. Church,2016,24,                      This is the film is not only the comeback that Eddie Murphy needed but the comeback he deserved.                  
The Letters,2015,29,                      [Juliet] Stevenson plays Mother Teresa from age 35 to 70 with a believability and resonance that radiates from within. The depth of conviction and humility which she imbues in the character took my breath away... Powerful fragility at its finest.                  
Haunters: The Art of the Scare,2017,100,"                      Entertaining... takes a deep dive into the subculture of people dedicated to creating haunted houses, mazes and other grim Halloween attractions.                  "
The Propaganda Game,2015,93,                      This is a snapshot accompanied by counter-claims that lacks any real digging into either. It all means that The Propaganda Game feels strangely inconsequential.                  
Score: A Film Music Documentary,2016,91,"                      SAFMD is a rare bird indeed. It can be enjoyed by the casual viewer as well as those who previously thought they knew everything about what shapes films. Once you see it, youll never hear movies the same way again.                  "
Chimera Strain,2018,60,                      The film has the eerie atmosphere and outstanding makeup effects of a good fantasy thriller. But it's way too choppy to build any tension.                  
Fresh Dressed,2015,91,"                      The establishment has reasserted itself, but hip-hop's sense of style - always fluid - has never diminished.                  "
The Confirmation,2016,91,"                      In many ways this story feels familiar, but there is an unglossed earnestness to every dramatic detail and a genuine, raw emotional undercurrent that makes it strikingly unique.                  "
Adult Life Skills,2016,75,"                      The feature debut of writer-director Rachel Tunnard, this is a such a charming bittersweet British indie. Just delightful.                  "
Toro,2016,80,                      A breakthrough film from a promising new filmmaker. [Full review in Spanish]                  
Western,2015,91,"                      While brave, the strategy slows the story to a crawl. Western is also hurt by its main subjects, neither particularly articulate or compelling.                  "
Courted,2015,91,                      And this is what Courted is truly about: the slow chipping away at the masks that shield us from the world and each other.                  
Kung Fu Yoga,2017,48,                      Not even Jackie Chan can save this ill-advised mash-up.                  
Widows,2018,91,"                      “Widows” may frame itself as a heist movie, but it can hardly be put in that box. McQueen has a much broader aim, and his film touches on a lot of different things.                  "
The Wall,2017,65,"                      ...mostly due to its modest length and effective lead performance, I'm inclined to give The Wall a modest recommendation...                  "
Top Spin,2014,100,                      Teens chase Olympic dreams in compelling sports documentary.                  
Tiger,2018,38,"                      Tiger's insistence on checking off boxes becomes distracting. This makes for a boxing film that has much to say, but lacks the overall punch in its delivery.                  "
The Babysitter,2017,72,"                      Director McG and writer Brian Duffield deserve a lot of credit for The Babysitter, it isn't groundbreaking but it's a damn fun film that has just enough laughs and just enough gore to keep everyone interested.                  "
Victoria,2015,82,"                      Filmed in one shot, this low-budget German crime drama is an unexpected triumph.                  "
Complete Unknown,2016,51,"                      Complete Unknown feels like a short story stretched as far as it could go, before it leaves our characters grasping out for the story to take them somewhere.                  "
Supernova,2014,10,                      ...a familiar yet promising setup that’s employed to predominantly underwhelming effect...                  
Tanna,2015,93,"                      ...a truly one-of-a-kind cinematic experience that thrills both as a marvel of filmmaking, and as a document of a world that, to many of us, would appear to be a land before time, safeguarded from the destructive arrival of the white man.                  "
The Last Duel,2021,85,"                      With the stakes set so high, Scott rises to the challenge and delivers a brutal, visceral “last duel” with complex narrative designs and a phenomenal carousel of performances.                  "
Alpha,2018,80,"                      The film takes on a plastic, almost sterile feel, and the rugged landscape is less of a character, where it needs to be the center of the movie, especially since Alpha is in serious need of some star power                  "
The Demons,2015,86,                      Les Démons is weakest when it is falls too self-consciously into ubiquitous cliches about gender and rites of passage. But ... at its best ... Les Démons is an extraordinary film about the coldness of childhood.                  
Kicks,2016,88,                      Kicks is not a terrible film. Kicks is an inconsistent film that lost its way. A film whose persistence in grimness takes away from what the viewers should really be concerned with Brandons story.                   
Miracles from Heaven,2016,45,                      The kind of film that will affirm the faith of believers yet even non-churchgoers will find much to love here.                  
The Witch,2015,90,"                      It chilled me in ways I am not even sure I was meant to be chilled. The language was very historically accurate, the environment felt isolated and hopeless and I loved how dug in the film was to documented cases of witches.                   "
Amateur Night,2016,0,"                      Jason Biggs plays a failing architect who becomes an Uber driver for a trio of Los Angeles hookers, one of whom is played by Ashley Tisdale in a salty performance intended to distance her from the sweet turns she did in the High School Musical films.                  "
Grandma,2015,91,"                      “Grandma” is a deceptively simple movie. Beneath the relatively straightforward plot, the film tackles complicated issues of access to abortion, mourning and loss, and the fight for women’s and LGBT rights with a light but insightful touch.                  "
Mojin: The Lost Legend,2015,56,                      This Chinese blockbuster heavily recycles elements from every Western adventure movie under the sun to create a cheap imitation of superior products ...                  
Bitch,2017,67,"                      It's a deeply personal, intimate piece of storytelling that holds within it dark, uncomfortable humor and pain.                  "
Feast,2014,55,"                      Even though the film knows it's a cheesy monster movie, that fact is not quite enough to transcend its scripting and construction as such.                  "
Seasons,2015,97,"                      For 80 minutes we are submerged in a sort of home movie, shot to the highest professional standard, of animals living their lives.                  "
We Are Never Alone,2016,83,                      It is a dynamic and engaging movie.                  
Gascoigne,2015,75,                      The movie is very much a celebration of a rare English footballing genius.                  
Across the Line,2015,83,                      All the drama focuses on the racism in the community.                  
Ladrones,2015,60,"                      One of those films you could see or not, doesn't really matter. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
Kubo and the Two Strings,2016,97,"                      An adventure marked by dark, occasionally heavy themes, and resounding tenderness.                  "
Lovesong,2016,83,"                      Lovesong lets its two main characters exist in both forms, arguing that such distinctions are superficial and, finally, that love is love.                  "
Ivy,2015,67,                      This is a brilliant piece of filmmaking: quiet in tone but deeply unsettling and entirely engrossing.                  
Darkness Rising,2017,0,"                      Darkness Rising has a few good ideas, some original ones even, but it's not scary and fizzles fairly quickly once it does ramp up.                  "
The Black Panthers: Vanguard of the Revolution,2015,92,                      An absorbing and timely look at the Black Panther Party and American police violence.                  
Big Eyes,2014,72,                      Quirky bits a humor shake the tone up a bit and Burton does several things with his camera that hearkens back to some of his earlier films.                  
Shot,2017,56,                      ... it's an effective film with plenty of talent behind and in front of the camera.                  
Union,2018,64,                      An exceptional film due to the history it sheds light on. [Full review in Spanish]                  
Julieta,2016,83,"                      Although Almódovar's cinematic adaptation is set in Madrid, a world away from the bleakness of Canadian landscape, described in Munro's stories as ""Rocks, trees, water, snow"" Julieta shares the same random intersections of fate.                  "
Alive and Kicking,2016,100,                      It is fast and exciting and I could watch it all day!                  
QT8: The First Eight,2019,92,                      I certainly find entertaining the way it reviews the first 21 years of the career of an extraordinary director who has already built a legend around his films. Full review in Spanish                  
Being 17,2016,95,"                      Being 17 is that most marvelous of finds, an instant classic on the subject French filmmakers have traditionally excelled at: truly messy love affairs.                  "
Fractured,2019,59,"                      It's not bad, but it's not particularly good. It tries to be a paranoid, conspiracy thriller with an issue about the reliability of its narrator, but I found it too predictable to be truly effective.                  "
Carnage Park,2016,61,"                      With a stark, spare style, and an almost unbearably stressful final 50 minutes, Carnage Park captures the look and feel of the back-end of a drive-in double feature.                  "
Frame by Frame,2015,93,                      Photographs help us learn of their stories by simply accounting for their existence.

Steps,2021,93,                      Morgan... may not be a household name but deserves to be recognized as one of the great film actors working today.                  
The Phoenix Incident,2015,50,                      ...well produced and enjoyable...                  
Queen of Katwe,2016,94,"                      The film plucks our heartstrings and, despite our awareness of its manipulative formula and inherent melodrama, it nonetheless accomplishes everything the story sets out to do with impressive precision.                  "
Mayhem,2017,84,                      Mayhem is one of those films that live up to their title. Here the mayhem and insanity is push up as much as it can without going overboard too much ...                  
Tar,2020,29,"                      There are several strong suits to Tar that bubble to the surface and keep your interest...However, Tar does get stuck in some of the muck that weighs it down with a lack of clarity and intent.                  "
The Last Black Man in San Francisco,2019,92,"                      ... The movie has quirks that might try your patience a little: its heroes are prone to hipster-ish flights of fancy, yet it offers both fine craftsmanship and comfortable warmth.                   "
The Wave,2019,68,"                      The Wave spotlights the writing on the wall for its most flawed characters, but also makes sure to settle on the base-level humanity of others. The result is an affecting and forward-thinking film that pinpoints what it means to be self-aware.                  "
A la mala,2015,43,"                      The thing is that this is not really a movie, it's just one of the biggest adds in movie history. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
Cross the Line,2020,100,                      Without the surrealist nocturnal jovialness of After Hours (1985) ... Cross the Line similarly uses an avalanche effect to take Dani through extreme situations that imperil her life and conscience. [Full review in Spanish]                  
Ghost House,2017,22,                      The film fills with simple solutions for difficult situations. [Full review in Spanish]                  
The Innocents,2016,95,"                      By the end it was clear to me that no character’s innocence would remain intact, but even the smallest light can offer a glimmer of hope. The film helps us remember that.                  "
Detour,2016,63,"                      The characters are never Characters, Capital C for Characters, like they need to be for something this stylized to take                  "
The Club,2015,88,"                      Arguably one of Larrain's most seditious narratives, a feat considering his stellar body of work, The Club is a stunning critique of organized religion, and will hopefully maintain the prolific shelf-life it deserves.                  "
The Pearl Button,2015,94,"                      This is a rapturous, unsettling movie about beauty, mystery, and unimaginable horror.                  "
Three,2016,89,"                      Though the film is still a worthwhile watch, and works well enough as a slick, if flimsy piece of occasionally thrilling fun, it's clearly a minor offering from the director                  "
The Greasy Strangler,2016,62,                      Definitely should have been a short film.

Hot Girls Wanted,2015,83,                      This documentary doesn't pull any punches and shows some of the best and worst aspects of working in the porn industry.                  
Station to Station,2015,71,"                      It's impossible to engage with this glib film, which feels like a very long mobile-phone advert.                  "
Army of One,2016,25,                      Army Of One doesn't add up to much.                  
Nine Lives,2016,14,                      You watch it and just wonder how in the world did this get made? I want to see the documentary about the making of Nine Lives.                  
We the People: The Market Basket Effect,2016,78,"                      This material is too good to completely bungle in a documentary, although We the People includes some ill-advised moments.                  "
Office,2015,87,"                      As always, To's sharpness is evident; just as he touches upon Hong Kong's affiliation with China in his mob movies, in this luminous musical, he points to the economic downturn... [Full review in Spanish]                  "
Bikes vs Cars,2015,60,"                      We are destroying the world that made us, that evolved us, and we have no idea if we will have a home in the world that is now replacing it...This is indeed the most important and sobering message in the rather melancholy documentary.                  "
Chocolat,2016,100,"                      The clown acts themselves are of their time but feel fresh, kinetic and organic, delivered with energy and joie de vivre, a reminder of the beauty in the art of clowning around.                  "
The Ballad of Lefty Brown,2017,80,"                      A perfectly passable ""horse opera"" and a fine vehicle for the ever-underappreciated Mr. Pullman -- who rides well, wears the hat and not the other way'round, and carries off a limp and a squint with the best of them.                  "
Ma,2015,92,"                      Ma is a complex artwork that engages with movement and space to suggest a cinematic form of body-talk, a language of resistant gesture and queer-feminist transformation.                  "
Slice,2018,52,"                      Slice is the kind of first try that makes this critic interested in seeing what Vesely will do next, as it's evident he has a lot of imagination and comedic chops, even though he didn't quite achieve anything memorable here.                  "
The Clan,2015,84,"                      ...these tricks become uninspired as they continue through the film, forgettable if not for its real life basis, and the truly confounding acts of the Puccio family.                  "
My Cousin Rachel,2017,76,"                      On balance, both screen versions of My Cousin Rachel are of comparable quality. Where this new version improves upon its 1952 predecessor is in the character of Rachel.                  "
My Big Night,2015,90,                      'Mi Gran Noche' is pure and simple entertainment that will attract the attention of the followers of the fast-paced and chaotic style of Álex de la Iglesia. [Full Review in Spanish]

Paris Can Wait,2016,47,                      I grew tired of their monotonous conversations and the utter lack of dramatic tension. I found myself annoyed at Jacques’ cloying banter and Anne’s wistful obedience. And I kept wondering who would ever fall for this guy?                  
Drishyam,2015,80,                      'Drishyam' is an unforgettable picture.                  
Ice Guardians,2016,100,"                      It's hard to fully engage with their justification of 50 years of violence. Despite this, Ice Guardians offers a well-researched view into a complex and weighty subject.                  "
Hannah,2017,82,                      It's a beguiling and opaque movie that doesn't quite provide the answers an audience needs to connect the dots.                  
Goat,2016,79,"                      A lesser movie about hazing would cluck its tongue and put on a mask of sympathy for these boys, painting them as victims. Goat has the temerity to let us see them as they see themselves. As survivors.                  "
Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising,2016,64,                      The law of diminishing returns comes down with Mjölnir force on this needless sequel.                  
High Tide,2015,93,"                      Despite High Tide's heavy- handedness, something satisfying comes in watching a commercial film focused entirely on independent women.                  "
Salt and Fire,2016,33,"                      If the film is a failure, it fails in the most fascinating, admirable, and lyrical ways.                  "
Hangman,2015,86,"                       ingeniously merges the tropes of ‘found footage’, home invasion and the slasher                  "
Wild Horses,2015,17,"                      It's a mess, a complete and utter mess, but shockingly, the movie is rarely dull, embracing just enough of Duvall's dedication to realism to make it bearable.                  "
Native,2016,50,"                      Native is an aesthetic piece of science fiction philosophy, which will certainly entertain a distinct crowd of people.                  "
As You Are,2016,68,                      It's exciting to see how easily this younger generation is able to dismantle heteronormativity.                  
Porto,2016,52,                      There's clearly an extra layer of sadness present that makes the experience of seeing Yelchin at his finest all the more painful and necessary.                  
Level Up,2016,50,"                      The action keeps the interest and the way it is shot lets you see it as it happens. The story's themes of love, testing oneself, regrets, and moving forward create more than a simple chase film.                  "
Clara,2019,54,"                      Clara is a small but perfectly played movie that deserves to be singled out for praise, for an intelligent storyline, for a genuine interest in science, and a romance that gives the film heart...                  "
Supercon,2018,23,                      Supercon is a fun watch that will bring some memories and some of the conventions ridiculousness to mind for those who have been or are current regulars.                  
The Sunshine Makers,2015,100,"                      This documentary meanders a bit as it goes between time periods, but it's never less than entertaining and illuminating.                  "
Dave Made a Maze,2017,86,"                      A weird little gem. The kind of horror flick that isn't great-great, but is simultaneously so of its era and so individual in its vision that it will get brought up later in lists...                  "
Honeymoon,2015,60,"                      ... effective in its brutality and as a film about the torture of one woman, not unlike many predecessors and much like Martyrs, it leaves the viewer in a weird spot mentally after watching it.                  "
Chronically Metropolitan,2016,40,                      Chronically Metropolitan is a coming-of-age dramedy but it doesn't come without some cynicism.                  
AWOL,2016,93,"                      [Lola] Kirke gives an amazing performance, but it's [Breeda] Wool who has the harder role, and effortlessly shines.                  "
Down Under,2016,65,"                      Hard to watch at times, that's the point of a comedy trying to expose a thorny topic still dividing Australia, an approach we could use a lot more of.                  "
Shaft,2019,34,"                      There is some much-needed comic-relief in this Shaft, but sadly this film hasn’t grown up when it comes to its treatment of women while still loving a good ’70s stereotype.                  "
The Gracefield Incident,2017,10,"                      What's frustrating about The Gracefield Incident is that it's not just a bad movie, but it offers a glimpse at the sort of ingenuity that would have elevated the film above its tired subgenre.                  "
Fatima,2015,84,                      All the clichés about immigrant life are present here.                  
Certain Women,2016,92,"                      The film feels like a singular arrangement under Reichardt's direction; her consistency of tone and theme separates into three stanzas, each a necessary component in a larger structure.                   "
The Magician,2015,100,"                      It is, quite literally at times, a romp.                  "
Fifty Shades Freed,2018,11,"                      It's as doofily entertaining, eye-rollingly awful, surprisingly steamy, and expectedly boring as all the other Fifty Shades films.                  "
Gifted,2017,73,"                      Gifted isn't just a great family film, it offers insight and lessons for a lifetime and might actually make you and your children better people. That's far more than you can expect to take away from any movie.                  "
The House,2017,20,                      Even movies like Requiem for a Dream and Midnight Express contain more laughs than The House.                  
Tikkun,2015,95,"                      Tikkun is intense, moody filmmaking and signals Sivan as one to watch for in the world of arthouse cinema.                  "
Aftermath,2014,47,"                      The shocks, and the repressed wickedness, as in all well-done horror films, build slowly, then reach a crescendo that is hard to bear and harder to shake off.                  "
Gored,2015,80,"                      it's quite often a mesmerizing film largely upon the strength of Barrera, a captivating and emotionally compelling figure with whom you can't help but feel completely in awe.                  "
All I See Is You,2016,29,"                      Despite an ending that layers on the drama and metaphor a bit more thickly than it needs to, this is a finely crafted piece of work and well worth looking out for.                  "
Killing Them Safely,2015,91,"                      A skillful, riveting film that proves to be every bit as electric as the device it's about.                  "
The Meddler,2015,85,"                      What Lorene Scafaria accomplishes here is deceptively simple, yet also profound and joyous. In the feel-good genre, few films stand out as more than formula and schmaltz. But Scafaria has made one of the best films of its kind.                  "
The Prodigy,2019,42,"                      It’s a competent watch, but don’t expect to remember it by the time you get to your car.                  "
Among the Believers,2015,95,"                      This isn't Friday night viewing, and there's certainly nothing groundbreaking here, but if you're interested in gaining insight into the rationale of Jihadism, this should certainly be a pitstop.                  "
Angels Are Made Of Light,2018,100,                      An engaging documentary about Afghanistan's youth that activates our empathy.                  
Manifesto,2015,75,"                      As a concept this may please some art students, but as entertainment it's a dud. Exactly why boredom sets in early has something to do with the difference between visual and dramatic art.                  "
Martin Eden,2019,87,                      I enjoy Martin Eden (and its soundtrack!) very much on a style level...                  
Morgan,2016,37,                      Has a lot in common with dozens of science-fiction stories but doesn't have any innovative ideas of its own.                  
Beauty Mark,2017,100,                      Every part of this film that goes to an unsettling place or each opposing moment that shows glimmers of hope within disparity hinge on the light shining out of Auden Thornton's extraordinary performance.                  
Chicuarotes,2019,18,"                      [García Bernal] has evolved his craft substantially, even if the progress fails to yield a fully formed and tonally cohesive outcome.                  "
Edge of Winter,2016,50,"                      Connolly and co-writer Kyle Mann deliver exactly the kind of film one would expect from the premise, but there's nothing wrong with someone getting an easy premise right on the first crack.                  "
Starfish,2016,76,                      Intense British drama about a family dealing with illness.                  
Overlord,2018,82,"                      While the trailers scream horror, “Overlord” packs just as much period war-time action and suspense.                  "
Sophie and the Rising Sun,2016,67,"                      The message of Sophie and the Rising Sun is incredibly timely. But despite fantastic performances from the cast and the beautiful message of acceptance, the film felt a little too safe and familiar.                  "
Robin Hood,2018,15,"                      All style, no substance, and yet another film at the end begging for a sequel in its final scene.                  "
Dilwale,2015,20,                      Even Shah Rukh-Kajol chemistry cannot save this disappointingly boring film.                  
The Monster Project,2017,50,"                      The film is not boring per sey, but it does not really bring that much new to the found footage plate and it over-uses chaotic images ...                  "
White Boy Rick,2018,57,                      The film is ultimately held together by a terrific supporting performance by Matthew McConaughey                  
Manhunt,2017,67,"                      One of the central pleasures of genre cinema is running your fingers along well-worn grooves, but while Man Hunt trots out a lot of chestnuts, it's the film's tendency to burn through them with bemusing haste.                  "
Brain Freeze,2021,75,                      It has nothing new to say about zombies.                  
I Kill Giants,2017,77,"                      With an imaginative premise framing a poignant tale of acceptance, the film is utterly delightful.                  "
Paradise,2016,70,                      Konchalovsky's latest masterwork is a pervasive scream of anguish from the not-too-distant past.                  
Darkest Hour,2017,84,"                      Joe Wright offers up compelling and timely lessons on conviction, persuasion, and the power of bipartisanship – all things our current governments could learn from.                  "
Armed Response,2017,0,"                      Armed Response has all the hallmarks of a film that was never fully thought through, and was made on a whim once some rogue investors misguidedly threw some money at the project.                  "
Crash Pad,2017,54,"                      The film normalizes what they do and hopes we laugh at it because they're ""just being boys."" Rather than tear down masculinity stereotypes, Crash Pad reinforces them.                  "
Crown Vic,2019,58,"                      This is mediocre, mostly forgettable drama, but it leaves a nasty taste.                  "
Downhill,2020,37,"                      The team behind Downhill doesn’t seem to be burdened with the guiding principle to make things interesting or fresh. All you have is a set of endless scenes of surreal nonsense, pure jibber-jabber, and that’s like traveling on a gondola ride to nowhere.                  "
This Beautiful Fantastic,2016,61,"                      All the actors are talented, but there's nothing to bite on to. This empty lacking. This quirky cutesy. This sugary syrupy. This irksome irritating. THIS BEAUTIFUL FANTASTIC.                  "
Dreamland,2016,67,                      All-in-all Dreamland shares the story of a larger-than-life figure and the journey that allowed him to forge himself as one of the most important writers in American history.                  
Journeyman,2016,85,"                      Considine in all round great filmmaker, as actor, writer and director, so let's hope we don't have to wait quite so long for his next movie.                  "
Mulan,2020,73,"                      Navigates through different terrains and attempts to cross a few borders. Sometimes it does so successfully, and sometimes it doesn't. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
Gabo: The Creation of Gabriel Garcia Marquez,2015,80,"                      In form, Gabo looks much like a PBS documentary, which isn't a bad thing, but a touch of the magical realism that illuminated his novels would've been nice.                  "
The Feeling of Being Watched,2018,93,                      The [film] is like an introductory handbook peeling back the layers on our government's activities to show how they willfully complicate our methods of keeping them in check.                  
Patriots Day,2016,80,"                      Patriots Day may tap into the emotional impetus of the intricate and complex investigation but, despite Berg's good intentions, his highly-detailed production recreates a national tragedy perhaps too soon and without enough perspective.                  "
Christopher Robin,2018,72,"                      Disney has made another uninspired live-action version of a heartwarming character by relying on derivative ideas, and the result amounts to an unabashed cash-grab dependent on name-brand awareness.                  "
Custody,2016,60,"                      It's all wildly contrived, but the classy and committed cast somehow make it work.                  "
ClownTown,2016,9,"                      ...maybe some years hence, Clowntown could be a therapeutic instrument designed to help poor coulrophobics overcome their deepest fear, once again allowing them the childlike joy that's eluded them at birthday parties and circuses.                  "
Reversion,2015,38,"                      The film keeps the mystery and intrigue going throughout its runtime while not giving everything away, making it a movie with a rewatchability factor.                  "
Rupture,2016,18,"                      Had loads of potential to be truly frightening, or at least intriguing, but it's dead on arrival.                  "
The Star,2017,43,                      Neither the humor nor the animation ever rises above humdrum.                  
Pinocchio,2022,27,"                      All in all, Pinocchio ends up as a frustrating experience. It never feels like the characters had arcs, even if that’s what the film wants you to believe.                   "
Population Zero,2016,78,"                      Overall, ""Population Zero"" is a film with an interesting subject but an execution that loses steam until that one scene near the end.                  "
Chi-Raq,2015,82,                      It's one of Lee's most accomplished and effective films in years.                  
Iona,2015,63,"                      The film's pace is slow and quiet, like the island. Dialogue is sparse - and its sparseness powerfully implies that there is much that still cannot be said even after the passing of time.                  "
The Guardians,2017,94,"                      A stirring World War I era story bathed in humanity and told through great performances, emotive faces and quiet communication.                  "
Bobby,2016,100,"                      Released to mark the 50th anniversary of England's World Cup triumph, this polished doc pays tribute to that winning team's golden-haired captain Bobby Moore.                  "
Blame,2017,81,"                      he film plays with a lot of high-school film tropes, but is smart enough to subvert them just enough to keep it feeling fresh.                  "
The Resistance Banker,2018,100,                      The Resistance Banker is made and acted with genuine commitment.                  
Heartstone,2016,84,                      It lacks that extra dose of inspiration to completely captivate the public. [Full Review in Spanish]                  
Purple Hearts,2022,35,                      Sophia Carson and Nick Galitzine come out of nowhere to win audiences over in this touching film directed with a careful touch by Elizabeth Allen Rosenbaum.                   
Peterloo,2018,67,"                      It's a masterfully made film, and a passionate statement from a humanist filmmaker that never resorts to drawing modern-day parallels; he does not need to, as the implications remain intractable.                  "
Like Crazy,2016,84,                      This one is a film that should be sought out and seen. It will make even grumps happy.                  
Strad Style,2017,100,"                      Strad Style is a serviceable look at the life of one completely unique individual, and considering that that is the extent of the film's ambitions, it's hard not to consider it a success.                  "
The Wasted Times,2016,20,"                      While The Wasted Times is not quite the ordeal its title may suggest, it nevertheless makes for convoluted, impenetrable viewing.                  "
Wolves,2016,36,"                      It all leads pretty much where you think it will, down the court on the ever counting clock, but the circuitous route's (mostly) worth traveling.                  "
Monstrous,2022,55,"                      This psychological twister doesn't entirely succeed, but it's anchored by a haunting lead performance from Ricci.                  "
Storks,2016,65,                      Storks has promise but never really delivers the goods.                  
The Other Half,2016,78,"                      ""The Other Half"" has the makings of a fascinating relationship piece and off-kilter love story.                  "
A Space Program,2015,87,                      I'll pass on this trip to Mars.                  
Among Wolves,2016,100,"                      By the end I understood that Convey's documentary isn't about the Bosnian War. It's about war, period...a reminder that sometimes people who survive the worst are capable of doing the best.                  "
Being Charlie,2015,23,"                      Being Charlie, despite having its heart in the right place, just isn't that movie.                  "
Gleason,2016,96,                      Gleason is a moving portrait of a remarkable fighter.                  
The Dancer,2016,59,"                      With its lush cinematography, compelling acting, and gorgeous dance performances, The Dancer makes good on Fuller's ambitions.                  "
Mr. Chibbs,2017,43,"                      while ""Mr. Chibbs"" never manages to transcend its formulaic approach, it remains a minor key delight, a thoughtful, resonant look at what it means to be Kenny Anderson.                  "
The Charnel House,2016,33,                      Tame horror you can watch with the whole family.                  
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,2018,97,                      But then you run into the storytelling – a frustrating swirl of highs and lows that shortchanges its most interesting component and emotional core.                  
The Chosen Ones,2015,85,"                      A film worth seeing, but far from enjoyable due to the hard subject it deals with. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
Little Wing,2016,78,"                      Little Wing is a touching film, and while it's dark at times, it is also unafraid to explore the complex problems facing a girl who is coming of age... it's a mature film that takes the women in it seriously, which is worthy of praise in its own right.                  "
Pyromaniac,2016,64,"                      There are glimpses of promise, but they burn out just as quickly as they ignite.                  "
Braid,2018,88,                      A very beautiful film... and it's not afraid to push the envelope.                  
The Keeper,2018,87,"                      An appealing cast sells the story, but questions of choice and complicity don't always fit neatly into a sports story that features a likable main character whose ""guilt"" is concentrated in a single war-time incident.                  "
God Willing,2015,54,"                      The story flows coherently, with great rhythm and lots of humor, it even has some surprisingly poetic moments. [Full review in Spanish]                  "

Harriet,2019,74,                      Cynthia Erivo puts in a potent turn in the title role.                  
Almost Christmas,2016,49,"                      Almost Christmas isn't a brilliant film, though it's an entertaining and satisfying one.                  "
Summertime,2016,92,                      What veteran director Catherine Corsini is able to do with the powerhouse performances by [Cécile De France and Izïa Higelin] is to weave the familiar moments of self-discovery into the broader narrative of the early days of the feminist movement.                  
Precious Cargo,2016,0,                      In its dialogue and not-exactly-enlightened attitude toward women it almost plays like a satire of b-movies.                  
Bad Moms,2016,58,"                      Although the plot may sound simple in its nature, it’s amazing how much self-described bad moms can do.                  "
Please Stand By,2017,56,                      A lukewarm movie with its heart in the right place.                  
Drifter,2016,42,"                      Drifter is a movie with some good ideas, some clear influences and references, a love for madness and cannibalism, some decent effects in general, and an atmosphere that feels just right for its post-apocalyptic desert story.                  "
Brave New Jersey,2016,50,"                      The period piece sets, costumes, vehicles, props, and other practical visuals are excellently handled.                  "
Joshy,2016,81,"                      Joshy is a little underwhelming when you first watch it, but the more you think about it and let it marinate, it tends to grow on you.                  "
All Nighter,2017,14,"                      It's slickly directed by Gavin Wiesen, and Seth Owen's script has a relaxed, freewheeling trajectory.                  "
All Saints,2017,95,"                      With the church on the verge of closing, Myanmar refugees gave the pastor and the tiny community, not only a chance to show true Christian care, but also a way to save the church.                  "
Eva,2015,43,                      Eva had me at the robotic cat.                  
By Sidney Lumet,2015,82,"                      By Sidney Lumet feels incredibly tame and safe, a film that serves more as an introductory lesson for freshmen film students.                  "
Christine,2016,88,"                      Subtly the film grows more unnerving with each step forward. Campos methodically puts together the pieces of this story, and it’s tough to endure knowing the tragic finale that lies ahead.                   "
The Unseen,2016,100,"                      ... an interesting take on the invisible man trope, showing a new way for the invisibility to take hold as well as a new source for it.                  "
Siren,2016,65,"                      This is fundamentally the main issue with SiREN as a whole. It's frequently, often laugh-out-loud funny but it's not nearly scary enough to qualify it as a decent horror-comedy.                  "
Beirut,2018,82,"                      Responsible for penning the likes of Michael Clayton and the Matt Damon Bourne series, writer Tony Gilroy adds more intrigue to his resume with this tense drama.                  "
The Sound,2017,25,                      A vaguely conceived suspenser that's unlikely to find much support among horror audiences with justifiably higher expectations.                  
The Head Hunter,2019,95,"                      Within this rich slice of fantasy horror is a subtle meditation on grief. The story is a tragedy of sorts, placed within a relentlessly harsh and despairing world.                  "
Loving,2016,88,"                      Director Jeff Nichols takes a restrained approach to the story, turning away from bombastic moments and letting Mildred and Richard’s quiet determination and unshakeable bond carry the story.                  "

American Fable,2016,76,"                      [American Fable] is a lovely film which smartly puts much of its faith behind young actress Peyton Kennedy, in the role of Gitty.                  "
Very Semi-Serious,2015,88,"                      An alternate history with humor that is bound to outlast even their latest digs, but still change is difficult and keeping vital remains a constant struggle.

Woodshock,2017,26,"                      If you've just baked some cookies and have a box of wine stashed somewhere, you are ready for this distinctive and druggy work of overwhelming beauty.                  "
Manic,2003,67,                      Powerful film packed with profanity and brutality.                  
Colossal,2016,81,                      The kaiju began as a metaphor but the way Nacho Vigolando turns it on his head with the personal struggles beset by alcoholism is funny and unnerving in equal measure. Anne Hathaway & Jason Sudeikis give career performances here.                  
Lavender,2016,39,                      This movie does not have any new ideas... but when an ending is good sometimes stuff can be forgiven.                  
Lost Child,2017,55,"                      At the end of the day, Leven Rambin still manages to hold the film together and as previously mentioned, its supernatural elements prove to be intriguing.                  "
The Seagull,2018,67,"                      I didn't hate The Seagull. I just forgot about it quickly after I left the theater. Like the love between two people in this world, the desire I had wasn't really genuine or strong enough to care about what happened next to these characters.                  "
Josie,2018,13,"                      A modern day noir, Josie is a film which only registers because of the performances from leads Sophie Turner and Dylan Mc Dermott.                  "
Loving Pablo,2017,31,                      'Loving Pablo' wants to address too much and fails to hit any of the aspects about Pablo Escobar's life. [Full Review in Spanish]                  
The Craft: Legacy,2020,48,"                      We could have had a new, updated, femme-fantasy future cult classic. Instead, we have this forgettable mess.                  "
Love Beats Rhymes,2017,44,"                      This movie overall is just ok, not outstanding in any way but it was nice to see a story like this with a black woman as the hero so it wasn't a complete waste.                  "
In the Tall Grass,2019,36,"                      There is only so much you can do with such a small amount of source material, and in compensating for that “In the Tall Grass” repeats itself too much.                  "
Beyond the Gates,2016,83,                      ... a fun horror-adventure film that is both modern and a nice throwback to the 80s and 90s.                  
Transpecos,2016,91,"                      A potent border fiction that matches high tension thrills with significant characters, played to perfection by Johnny Simmons, Clifton Collins Jr. and Gabriel Luna.                  "
Ben,2014,60,                      A terrible follow-up with an insufferable protagonist.                  
Macbeth,2014,49,"                      Something weakened this way comes, you could say.                  "
Domain,2016,71,"                      This high concept, low budget movie manages to create a tense intrigue throughout by moving the story along through the guess-the-mystery, intensive dialogues and claustrophobic single-settings.                  "
Once Upon a Time in Venice,2017,21,"                      Stuff happens in Venice, but it never feels like it's building toward anything, either as a payoff for the setpieces it subjects us to or as a subversion of expected payoff.                  "
The Pickle Recipe,2016,36, 
It Comes at Night,2017,88,"                      It’s an unconventional horror picture. It’s a deep emotional treatment of loss. It’s a troubling, unorthodox coming-of-age story. The cool thing is how well Trey Shults packages all these things together without an ounce of conflict.                  "
Nails,2017,40,                      The story is confined to one location and our main character has been rendered mute and static.                  
All the Time in the World,2015,75,"                      When her family decided to spend nine months in a cabin in the Yukon, filmmaker Suzanne Crocker brought her camera, and the result is a quietly revealing story about a family's quality time together.                  "
Neruda,2016,93,                      Neruda has no answers for these questions but it asks them in a moving way that sometimes feels like a new achievement in the abilities of narrative.                  
Up for Love,2016,39,"                      The plot's a supermarket sweep, but Up for Love displays a lot of technical elegance.                  "
Believe,2016,33,"                      Believe might be earnest to a fault, but it's hard to totally a knock a movie so eager to please.                  "
Bumblebee,2018,91,                      “Bumblebee” is a good spin-off that easily stands on its own unique merits.                  
The Mermaid,2016,95,"                      A little wacky, a little off-kilter in its world view, and deceptively clever throughout. As has been the case for many of the best-known works of director Steven Chow.                  "
Birthmarked,2018,11,"                      This is a dumb movie about people who are allegedly smart, and it was an aggravating experience to watch.                  "
6 Days,2017,63,"                      If not entirely compelling, 6 Days gives us a little to chew on from several different perspectives of these well-known events.                  "
Heil,2015,20,                      Heil is a completely different monster: a broad cultural satire fashioned as a b-comedy and seeping with disdain towards a hypocritical society failing to wipe out the traces of its heinous past.                  
The Long Dumb Road,2018,75,                      Taissa Farmiga and Grace Gummer make particularly welcome appearances here.                  
Love Is Blind,2019,33,"                      It has interesting things to say about grief and relationships and good performances, but it fails to sell the audience on the romance.                  "
Trash,2015,66,"                      Trash is a magical film, possessing the ability to simultaneously anger you and lift your spirits as you are taken for a thrilling ride through the injustice of life in Rio de Janeiro.                  "
Curvature,2017,44,"                      A decent, if slightly frustrating, experience but worth your time if you like stories about time.                  "

The Exception,2016,75,"                      Philandering Nazis, saucy servants, preposterous subterfuge — there’s a touch of ’Allo ’Allo! in this espionage wartime thriller.                  "
From Afar,2015,78,                      The filmmakers dare to step up the stakes of their ballet of blood and bruises without ever turning us off or making us less than complicit in this dirty little war.                  
Slack Bay,2016,65,                      A bourgeois farce made by a filmmaker who is above such silly matters.                  
Waiting for You,2017,60,                      I've always been a fan of Dixon as a rising filmmaker who demonstrates a masterful use of camera work and sound...                  
Killing Ground,2016,74,                      Recycles a number of backwoods-slasher tropes that will only really satiate devotees of the subgenre.                  
The Last Photograph,2017,67,"                      Huston's work is invested and sincere, but the pathos of his film is just too detached and formulaic.                  "
Apostasy,2017,97,"                      Armageddon may not come during APOSTASY, but Kokotajlo's film chronicles the destruction of smaller and more personal worlds in a manner that grips from genesis to final revelations.                  "
Slash,2016,92,"                      The film is touching in parts and a bit cringe-worthy in others, which are both good things here.                  "
A Cure for Wellness,2016,42,"                      Sheer peculiarity may earn A Cure for Wellness devoted enthusiasts, but those hoping for story logic or emotional involvement will feel unfulfilled.                  "
Attraction,2017,36,"                      It's so four-quadrant in its attempts to be both gritty and funny, romantic and action-packed, that it never gets to develop significantly in any particular direction.                  "
Jacqueline Argentine,2016,29,"                      If you take Jacqueline (Argentine) for what it is, it can be quite a bit of fun.

The Last Heist,2016,20,"                      Some of it, like the ending, becomes a bit much, but Rollins and Coombs presences along with an interesting story with plenty twists and a good pace make it worth checking out.                  "
After Love,2016,90,"                      After Love is a film of harsh truths and humanistic empathy, finding a middle ground between love turned to hate and tolerance so that one may more fully love one's children.                  "
Sweet Dreams,2016,52,"                      A heart-wrenching story of motherly love and the value of family, Sweet Dreams' most powerful moments lean heavily on sentimentality. You're left exhausted (in a good way) by the end.                  "
42 Grams,2017,100,"                      All in all, this doc offers a sumptuous meal for lovers of fine food and the challenges of creativity.                  "

I Declare War,2014,72,"                      It remains enclosed within the forest and the limitless possibilities therein, never interrupting the gameplay with anything too real, so in the end, everyone can go home to play videogames, eat pizza, or watch Patton.                  "
Whisky Galore,2016,42,                      Fairly straightforward remake.

The Promise,2016,51,                      Movies like Lawrence of Arabia and Reds had the ability to sweep viewers away with their passion and grandeur. The only sweeping to be found in this case will be by the theater employee tasked with removing spilled popcorn from the auditorium floor.                  
Imperium,2016,84,                      The film fails to engage because of its miscast leading man and its unsuccessful attempts to elevate itself above a standard undercover cop yarn.                  
Lights Out,2016,75,"                      It does employ a few all-too-familiar tricks, but they certainly don’t undercut the many things the film deserves credit for.                  "
Homebound,2021,70,"                      While Homebound features some solid acting and dreamlike direction, it's let down by a script that trades depth and development for briskness.                  "

King of the Belgians,2016,86,"                      An exercise of artistic freedom, in short, culminating in an unpretentious film, sometimes fun, sometimes not so much, but certainly never seen before. [Full Review in Spanish]                  "
Only You,2015,25,"                      Despite being billed as a rom-com, it lacks the charming, whimsical vibe of the 1994 version with Robert Downey Jr and Marisa Tomei.                  "
The Bandit,2016,86,"                      All of the stock footage, old interviews, and behind the scenes shots were fairly interesting, but what we get about Burt Reynolds and Hall Needham were from a surface level.                  "
The Journey,2016,68,                      The Journey does little to elevate its limited premise...                  
High Life,2018,82,"                      It may be too lofty to call High Life a microcosm of humanity; then again, it may not be. Denis seems to liken the isolation of a few people trapped on a ship hurtling through space to the entire human experience.                   "
The Sense of an Ending,2017,75,                      The problem with 'Sense of An Ending' might not be the main character's tone-deaf approach to his female relationships but the filmmaker's.                  
The Persian Connection,2016,63,"                      The Persian Connection is bold, tense, and thrilling, even if its thematic reach just exceeds its grasp.                  "
Sultan,2016,73,                      An unusually ambitious Khan-daan marred by genre tropes.                  
We Are X,2016,83,"                      If [Stephen] Kijak's documentary hits a few familiar beats along the way, it's hard not to be moved by emotional footage of fans across the world finding solace and support in the absolutely unstoppable Yoshiki's life's work.                  "
True History of the Kelly Gang,2019,80,"                      At every turn, Kurzel challenges truth and oversimplified ideas about the Australian legend with a bold presentation, even as he avoids having a clear point of view.                  "
Good Time,2017,92,"                      Good Time is a frantic ride, but at the core of the film is the brothers' relationship. Both are desperate to get out of New York and start a new life, even if they have to borrow and steal to achieve it.                  "
Into the Inferno,2016,92,"                      Inferno is yet another entertaining philosophical musing -- the second offering this year, after his Lo, and Behold, Reveries of the Connected World -- from the master storyteller. And I couldn't be happier.                  "
Blood Feast,2016,40,"                      Blood Feast is a decent remake, a bloody film with an opening sequence that catches the attention with its plentiful blood and boobs.                  "
XOXO,2016,71,"                      Saturated in neon, gratifyingly loud, and a wonderful showcase for charismatic supporting actor Brett DelBuono, you can certainly imagine XOXO finding an audience with the post-SpongeBob, pre-Orange Is The New Black demographic.                  "
Rumbos,2016,60,"                      Rumbos' is a film that outlines interesting aspects about solitude and human relations in big cities, but fails to attain a true entity that distinguishes it from the rest of the films about crossed stories [Full review in Spanish]                  "
Stargirl,2020,68,"                      A music video posing as a feel good film, Stargirl - like the source material - inherently misunderstands its own message about non-conformity and inadvertently recreates a tired celebration of the manic pixie dream girl. A YA disaster.                  "
Camino,2016,35,"                      Taggart's most gruelling fight comes early in the film and while it is impressive to witness, none of her physical conflicts after rise to that level. Still the film is a fun entry into this genre.                  "
Hollow in the Land,2017,53,                      More of a snapshot of life in a small town than it is a murder mystery.                  
Baaghi,2016,30,"                      t's bad manners for moviegoers to use their phones in theatres. But then again, it's bad manners to make a movie like Baaghi and release it in these halls.                  "
Most Beautiful Island,2017,94,"                      Most Beautiful Island not only tests the idea of a traditional horror film, but it exceeds the confines of that definition                  "
Swiped,2018,17,                      You might want to swipe left on Swiped.                  
The Perfect Match,2016,22,                      It's more like cold garbage; it's harder to swallow.                  
The Intervention,2016,78,"                      The Intervention is a sweet and bittersweet drama, marking a comfortable debut for [Clea] DuVall's directorial career.                  "
The Student,2016,87,"                      Ironically allows antireligious pedagogics and dogmas overtake [Kirill Serebrennikov's] story, itself a cautionary tale on the dangers of pedagogical and dogmatic thinking.                  "
The Last Supper,2014,62,                      Arsenic and old cliches...

Footnotes,2016,65,"                      Footnotes is worthwhile watch with some fun, light sequences, an obsession with shoes, and a message about globalization that is passes rather easily and not forcefully.                  "
The Misfits,2021,17,                      Waiting for it to finish is like sitting bored on a hard plastic chair and then realising your phone has run out of battery but the charger is packed in a suitcase you already checked in.                  
Ripped,2017,0,                      Interminable                  
No Home Movie,2015,89,"                      From her revolutionary depiction of real-time onscreen to her almost voyeuristic style of shooting her own life, No Home Movie epitomizes every quality that made Chantal Akerman's cinema so groundbreaking.                  "
Zappa,2020,96,                      The style does bring a flamboyancy to the craft and creates methods that endear one to the brash yet creative persona of this particular artist.                  
Calendar Girls,2015,0,                      I wonder if any industry insiders care anymore that their lives are hung out to dry by one of their own chaps. And it's not even fun to watch.                  
Temple,2017,27,"                      I almost wish the film had been less of a sketch and more of a fully formed idea, giving the characters more room to develop and the temple's legends more color and depth. Still, what's here has a handful of worthy moments of terror and intrigue.                  "
Creepy,2016,90,"                      Kurosawa shows, in masterful way, that creepiness lurks at the surface of society, just behind the façade of daily life, hidden in plain sight.                  "
Queen of Spades: The Dark Rite,2015,40,                      Queen of Spades: The Dark Rite is a contemporary Russian horror that is pleasing to the eye and holds up to any North American teen horror franchise.                  
Reborn,2018,53,                      ...engaging horror that has a real nous about it...                  
Rebirth,2016,43,                      The story has a lot of fun nesting-doll itself outward so you're never quite sure where its fantasy ends and total oblivion begins                  
The Wretched,2020,74,"                      THE WRETCHED has so much working in its favor, but it needed to be more fine-tuned to avoid some tone issues and plot holes.                  "
Danger Close,2017,20,"                      Danger Close fetes veterans less than it does Quade, who gets to talk herself up, often in an unseemly manner, coming across as braggadocios about her own bravery even as she pays lip service to the solemnity of her job.                  "
Citizen Soldier,2016,86,"                      Where other good war docs have done more of the storytelling retrospectively, the directors here bounce around in-the-moment POV angles to keep us in the action.                  "
Goldstone,2016,76,                      Goldstone's scattershot themes are too unfocused and its characters too underdeveloped to hit home.

Rush,2014,88,"                       Howard creates a persuasive sense of the time and place, and the race sequences are impressively mounted. This is thrillingly tense stuff, even if you know how the story panned out.                  "
The Curse of La Llorona,2019,28,                       “La Llorona” gets off on the right foot and Cardellini does what she can. But it’s yet another Conjuring installment built on a promising idea but with execution that feels all too familiar.                  
Just Mercy,2019,85,"                      While succumbing to a small amount of melodrama, Just Mercy is ultimately a moving film about integrity, injustice, and the indictment of our criminal justice system.                  "
Karate Kill,2016,71,                      A workable facsimile of the Cannon Films assembly line action fare a generation grew up discovering on warped VHS tapes.                  
Little Men,2016,97,                      The film's revelatory performances are turned in by Theo Taplitz and Michael Barbieri.

Parallel,2018,82,"                      Tonally, it's muddled, struggling to manage its comedy beats and darker impulses. Still, the performances and Scott Blaszak's to-the-point script make the film easy to like, in spite of its flaws.                  "
"Kiki, Love to Love",2016,73,                      While Kiki is an interesting movie the humour in the main didn't work for me.                  
The Invisible Guardian,2017,20,"                      Someone said that the actors are not directed, they are chosen... fragile and strong, wounded and determined, the protagonist of The Invisible Guardian is the perfect choice. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
The Nest,2019,60,"                      The biggest stumbling block is that the filmmaker, like Shyamalan, is much more interested in wowing with the final reveal... than in constructing a solid story. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
Tomato Red: Blood Money,2017,67,"                      Friel, the film's Southern-noir stylings and Wilson's stealthy composition, are the strong cards here. Its two central characters, however, could have done with a bit more narrative purchase for us to hold on to and get behind.                  "
Heart of a Dog,2015,96,"                      Heart of a Dog is a triumph and not simply in its love and candor, but in its calming ease that gently reminds viewers: no matter what, everything will be OK.                  "
Amazing Grace,2018,99,"                      ​It took 47 years to reach theaters, but the documentary ""Amazing Grace"" is sheer musical bliss.                  "
Mascots,2016,48,"                      Netflix's Mascots, the latest ""mockumentary"" from actor-filmmaker Christopher Guest, is a fairly inconsequential and not terribly funny movie.                  "
Our Last Tango,2015,90,"                      Combined with key memories re-enacted through a group of dancers, the tango sequences are mesmerising and beautifully choreographed, bringing a stylised grace that is both unique and technical at the same time.                  "
Jean of the Joneses,2016,75,                      The greatest treat of Jean of the Joneses is the immigrant heritage of the films plays right on the surface.                  
Silicon Cowboys,2016,100,                      An absorbing tale.                  
Make Me Famous,2021,100,                      In restoring Brezinski to the canon — in positioning him alongside towering figures like Haring and Basquiat — the documentary might just wind up doing what the desperate exclamation in its title asks for.                  
Risen,2021,20,"                      Risen wont fare well with impatient streamers. Writer-director Eddie Arya should be applauded for his creative ambition, but even the most forward-thinking filmmakers need strong performances to sell their product.                  "

Mirrors,2013,14,"                      Always thought there was an evil design behind all those giant mirrors at clothes stores. But how evil are they? Put Alexandre Aja behind the camera, and what do you think?                  "
Touch Me Not,2018,59,"                      'Touch me not' is an audiovisual essay about the limits. The mental, corporeal and social limits. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
The Fixer,2016,60,"                      Despite some atmospheric touches, the film doesn't offer much meaningful insight into the struggle of a man trying desperately to assimilate into a new culture.                  "
Raw,2016,93,"                      In juxtaposing her main character’s sexual awakening with her burgeoning cannibalism, director Julie Durconeau challenges the often fraught relationship between female violence and sexuality in horror.                  "

Keep the Change,2017,100,                      A sensitive but realistic portrait of a man and a woman dating along the autism spectrum in today's overpriced and socially challenging NYC.                  
Rondo,2018,80,"                      Despite its flaws, Rondo still has enough intrigue to make it worth watching once if violent crime thrillers flick your switch                  "
Our Father,2021,42,                      Smith can’t quite hit the landing of making it feel intentionally hollow.                  
Moonlight,2016,98,"                      The director's filmmaking radiates a poetry in his storytelling and visual aesthetic, creating a film that resonates with the viewer in the head and heart.                   "
The Kid,2019,44,                      “The Kid” is a fresh venture across some well-traveled cinematic territory.                   
Priceless,2016,40,"                      There is something honest, open, and priceless in the telling of the story of Priceless. Thought-provoking, eye-opening and uplifting.                  "
Marjorie Prime,2017,90,"                      Marjorie Prime is a movie about memory but it's also a movie about identity, arguing convincingly eloquently that the two are synonyms.                  "
Pitchfork,2016,20,                      Pitchfork is defined by a country dance sequence with full boot-stomping choreography - not a great sign for a horror movie.

The Black Hen,2015,100,"                      A film of a remarkable visual force, Kalo Pothi seems a more interesting work in the anthropological aspect than in a cinematographic one. [Full review in Spanish]                  "

The Square,2017,85,"                      The film’s execution only occasionally reaches its ideological grasp, but Östlund’s such a talented filmmaker that he can cover up the lack of follow-through in his script. That’s tough to do!                   "
Lovesick,2016,50,"                      Lovesick is an impressive first feature for Caron.

Vaya,2016,100,"                      The story line of Vaya is packed, but Omotoso manages to make every minute as thrilling as the next.                  "

"Everything, Everything",2017,45,                      Pretty predictable as Maddy is willing to risk it all to experience life and be with Olly. A horrifying twist in the third act turns the film dark and the issues it raises are never addressed. The story pretty much falls apart at that point.

Dunkirk,2017,92,                      Dunkirk was a pivotal early moment in World War 2 and the Dunkirk spirit is something that has lived on through those most closely affected by it.

Shelley,2016,92,"                      It's one of those films that are just made up of moments instead of scenes and I really, really enjoyed that.                  "
Change in the Air,2018,11,"                      Unfortunately for viewers, Brosnahan gets to show more range in a single scene of House of Cards than she does in this entire movie.                  "
Kill Ratio,2016,0,                      Kill Ratio does little to transcend its Die Hard framework.                  
Hush,2016,93,"                      It's a terrific modern slasher, and even got the seal of approval from Stephen King.                  "
The Last Word,2017,40,"                      What we have is a film built around a character arc that we never really see play out, and while it is intermittently funny, it rings hollow as a weekly sitcom.                  "

The Quiet One,2019,64,                      [Bill] Wyman's refusal to acknowledge the scandalous mess resulting from his relationship with Mandy Smith is not the only example of how Wyman may not be the most reliable narrator of his life story that he tells in this movie.                  
Cruise,2018,38,"                      Coming after ""Big Fan,"" it's a disappointment, finding the helmer getting caught in cliché he managed to avoid before.                  "
The Assignment,2016,33,"                      Even moving beyond its sticky politics, The Assignment is simply a lousy film.                  "
The Rainbow Experiment,2018,56,"                      It's a strong idea that isn't executed as it should have been in order to produce a wholly engaging piece, and though clearly created with care, The Rainbow Experiment ends up less enthralling than its titular incident.                  "
Finale,2018,50,"                      Tense opening half introducing two young women who are destined to be part of a torture show in the second half. Watch it if you want, but the film will try to chastise you for doing so.                  "
Mantra,2017,40,"                      A few perceptive moments from the film will remain with me, but I suspect it'll be more in the language of unrelated memories; I wouldn't know where to place them, or why they appeal to me in a particular context.                  "
The Light of the Moon,2017,97,"                      The production values are low and other than Stephanie Beatriz's excellent work, the performances are amateurish, yet the film is thoughtful and detailed and non-exploitative.                  "
Desolation,2017,58,"                      A slow-burn horror flick that never quite goes anywhere, making the proceedings feel inconsequential and lackluster.                  "
The Box,2015,43,"                      this lush, intelligent, frustrating film is probably better for keeping the precise nature of its mystery intact; thats what makes The Boxs central metaphor sing                  "

Get Out,2017,98,"                      Peele clearly aims to make a movie that can be several different things at once, but I’m not sure any of the film’s multiple identities are all that strong.                  "
Operator,2016,100,"                      More droll than funny, more interesting than charming, but a couple of killer scenes and engaging leads let this romance pay off.                  "
Final Destination,2013,35,"                      This clever twist on the slasher sub-genre is good, gory fun and features one of the best death scenes ever put on film.                  "
I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House,2016,60,                      I Am The Pretty Thing That Lives in the House is the slowest of slow-burn ghost stories (featuring the return to cinema of the incomparable Paula Prentiss after ages) about a young woman working as a caregiver and attendant for a reclusive novelist.                  
Promise at Dawn,2017,64,"                      Powered by rivetting performances and fluid, hand-held camera work, La Promesse is a coming-of-age film with an emotional appeal that is honest and unswerving.                  "
Hostile Border,2015,67,"                      Hostile Border starts off intriguingly enough, but quickly spirals downward without ever gaining any momentum... More importantly, the film struggles with its own themes.                  "
Aloys,2016,80,"                      Director Tobias Nolle's first full-length film is a tense, dark thriller that delves into contemporary issues of digital isolation, technology, surveillance and privacy.                  "
The Wilde Wedding,2017,27,"                      As star-studded of a cast that this film has, The Wilde Wedding could certainly be improved on. It offers nothing new to the genre.                  "

Below Her Mouth,2016,21,"                      The recycled dialogue and characters in this movie that haven't been updated to reflect a change in the tides... have absolutely no business being in a movie in the great year of our lord, 2017.                  "
Color Out of Space,2019,86,                      A lovingly crafted Lovecraft adaptation... It features some of the most gruesome practical effects work seen since The Thing                  
The Isle,2018,67,"                      Low-budget earnest but bland attempt at a horror/suspense thriller that just can't overcome a stale, predictable and unimaginative plot.                  "
Trash Fire,2016,69,"                      All of the performances in this film were strong, but those of Fionnula Flanagan and Angela Trimbur definitely stand out.                  "
Victoria,2016,83,"                      Shot in one continuous take, this is a gripping story of a night out gone weird.                  "

The Invitation,2016,89,"                      The Invitation is best when it turns the cranks on an already uncomfortable social reunion, but the film doesn't shirk on the horrifying payoff either.                   "
The Favourite,2018,93,                      “The Favourite” shines brightest through its top-notch performances across the board and in the sheer beauty of the filmmaking. That light fades when you get down to the meat of the storytelling.                  
Hostile,2017,60,"                      [T]he melodramatic direction, tone-deaf dialogue, predictable plot, and overly intellectual transitions caused me to check out, mentally[.]                  "

Finders Keepers,2017,98,                      Its focus on the humanity underneath the absurdity keeps it from being an historical footnote.                  
Cinderella,2015,83,"                      There are moments of CGI animal nonsense that seem to exist completely separate from the live-action beauty Branagh has created, and that awkward juxtaposition leaves the entire film feeling uneven, at times admirable, and at others condemnable.                  "
A Bag of Marbles,2017,83,                      This French tape has a remarkable Hollywood treatment that does not minimize its quality. [Full review in Spanish]                  
Ant-Man and the Wasp,2018,87,                      The sequel is funnier and the action has a delightfully playful flavor. And the stakes here are more personal.                  
Dancer,2016,88,"                      If you're in any doubt that ballet is an all-consuming, gruelling profession that can test you to your limit, and beyond, Dancer is one to watch. If you knew that already, watch it anyway...                  "
Noelle,2019,55,"                      Noelle is pleasant to watch, but is almost exclusively dependent on the heaping amount of charm that Anna Kendrick brings to the table.                  "
Isle of Dogs,2018,90,"                      The huge and talented cast offer up superb voice work, and they all meld seamlessly into Anderson’s handsomely idiosyncratic world.                  "
Raya and the Last Dragon,2021,94,"                      Not a bad movie, but doesn't take any risks. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
Super Dark Times,2017,90,                      The realism in this film is more than any other film that's been on this list. It's true and it's sad and it's... heartbreaking but it doesn't make much sense unfortunately.                  
Ghost Team,2016,11,"                      Ghost Team is the worst of independent releases in that it's going to be successful based on the names boasted on the cover, yet leave every single viewer disappointed.                  "
Togo,2019,93,"                      Disney goes back to the well like no other with a throwback to films like White Fang, Balto, and Iron Will with a big family adventure film that swells with heart and builds genuine suspense.                  "

Coyote Lake,2019,83,"                      Although Coyote Lake doesn't deviate too much from the narrative you would expect, it's the details Seligman incorporates throughout that make this thriller a promising debut.                  "
Peter Rabbit,2018,63,"                      A loud and abrasive film populated by cute creatures and zippy, restless humor.                   "
True Conviction,2017,83,                      An immensely involving film.                  
Orange Sunshine,2016,100,"                      [Orange Sunshine] makes for unbalanced viewing, but it also reflects and helps us better understand the time period it lovingly recreates, for better or worse.                  "
For Ahkeem,2017,96,                      For Ahkeem poignantly unfolds with all the accouterments of a narrative film.                  
I Am the Blues,2015,100,                      It is as if as each musician tells his tale and strums his guitar that everything is ok again. The music is their release and all of the sadness comes out in the songs.                  
The Bar,2017,88,                      The blocking this film was fantastic... the power play between the characters is really something to look out for.                  
The Confession,2016,100,                      What makes The Confession so effective is that we as viewers are never explicitly asked to take Moazzam Begg's side; merely to listen to what he has to say.                  
Poms,2019,36,"                      Making a movie about seniors who are self-confident and connected with each other and the younger generation in a meaningful way is a noble goal. Unfortunately, Poms doesn't make the cut.                  "

Forsaken,2016,42,"                      By relying on uninspired Western tropes over true grit, Forsaken is forgettable.                  "
The Death of Louis XIV,2016,88,                      The irony of the king's death is heightened by its straightforward presentation and procedural approach. The Death of Louis XIV is a very singular formalist filmmaking in its highest order.                  
King Cobra,2016,49,"                      There is definitely a great film to be made about the gay porn industry, but unfortunately, King Cobra is not it.                  "
An Eye for an Eye,2016,71,"                      ... a hard documentary to watch in parts due to some of the subject matter and some of the footage used, but it's one a lot of people should watch and could learn a thing or two from.                  "
Off the Rails,2016,100,"                      A fascinating documentary, thanks to McCollum's personality and presence, but the strength of the doc is how it exposes the flaws in the system.                  "
Shotgun,2018,84,"                      After Everything is a remarkably honest, bittersweet, and fresh romance. It honestly depicts a relationship that’s at times both unique and all too familiar.                  "
Burden,2016,97,"                      Even those who might not understand the enigmatic figure at first will be fascinated, but for those who appreciated his daring, a deeply rewarding portrait awaits.                  "
Headshot,2016,74,"                      Long-time fans expected a gleefully violent ride - which they got - but what no one was expecting was for them to take to the frenetic action genre like ducks to water, producing one of the decade's most brutal action movies.                  "
Indivisible,2017,74,"                      Sarah Drew gives a tremendously sensitive, informed performance.                  "
Tony Robbins: I Am Not Your Guru,2016,45,                      Inspiring but biased docu; lots of cursing.                  
Golden Boy,2018,67,"                      With a story so detailed that it feels autobiographical, this earthy, natural drama can't help but catch the audience by surprise as it pushes the characters through a series of intense situations.                  "
Mommy,2015,88,"                      ...for all of Steve's livewire energy, the hero of Mommy is never in doubt. Anne Dorval is simply amazing as the indomitable Die...                  "
First Love,2019,98,"                      Every time Miike could go completely off the rails, he reins himself in, pulling back where barging ahead would make this an even more memorable (if messier) experience.                   "
The Discovery,2017,46,                      ...luckily-unlike prior Netflix original films with stars like Paul Rudd and Ellen Page-this one merits watching...                  
Force 2,2016,55,"                      Director Abhinay Deo slides in tired themes of patriotism and politicians, but at no point does it seem that these two are not in charge.                  "
The Lure,2016,89,                      Half the fun of this full-blown choreographed musical is that you can't believe what you are seeing. The other half is watching Golden dispatch leering drunks.                  
Western,2017,96,"                      ...a film that simmers rather than boils, but Grisebach conjures an atmosphere and intensity which seeps into every inch of the screen.                  "
The Pass,2016,89,"                      In a film brimming with ideas, its execution falls somewhat flat. Despite good casting, the acting never lives up to the script, which itself is flawed by self-imposed structural limitations.                  "
Lizzie,2018,66,"                      Lizzie doesn't answer all the questions, but gradually gains strength and shape until it transmits to the audience the suffocating oppression, and psychological and physical abuse that abounded in this sick home. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
Hide and Seek,2009,12,"                      Hide and Seek is a silly exercise on bad horror films that starts promisingly enough, but quickly erodes into a movie that has more laughs than thrills.                  "
SOMM: Into the Bottle,2015,79,"                      Somm is the rare documentary that truly has you invested from the very beginning, takes you on an emotional roller coaster, and teaches you something about a topic you may otherwise never have learned.                  "
Bling,2016,33,                      There's so much better out there that you can put the kiddos in front of. Bling just didn't do it for me I'm afraid.                  
Gold,2017,41,                      A movie that is completely hollow and only saved by Matthew McConaughey's committed performance.                  
In Darkness,2018,47,                      Natalie Dormer gives a passionate performance in a thriller with a moody style but not many interesting new ideas.                  
The Land,2016,70,"                      The four young leads do phenomenal work, the characters and setting are fleshed out and authentic, and the supporting players are top notch (including an unexpectedly chilling villain).                  "
The Starling,2021,19,                      The Starling is a manipulative cinematic therapy session equivalent to treating depression with a Flintstones vitamin. The wrong blend of comedy and drama.                  
What Lies Upstream,2017,100,"                      Perhaps this new denouement is more provocative than the original; the overall content is certainly compelling enough to motivate audiences, or voters, to take action.                  "
The Chamber,2016,33,"                      Single location films like The Chamber are faithfully reliant on character structures and evolutions, which is where Ben Parker's execution falters most.                  "
"I, Daniel Blake",2016,92,"                      It's impossible to watch this movie without being forced to cope with bouts of sadness and helplessness -- it's honest and uncompromising, although moments of humor do manage to break loose.                  "
Inside,2016,28,"                      [A]lthough Inside is very contrived and silly, it's also fun, entertaining, stylistically interesting and, at times, blackly comic                  "
Wild Nights with Emily,2018,89,"                      The performances are superbly judged, as are the period trappings, but it's the mordant tone of Olnek's dialogue that makes this such an intellectual treat and a comic delight.                  "
Billionaire Boys Club,2018,7,"                      While this version may actually be closer to the real-life incidents that took place, it is still a bit of a draggy affair.                  "
Slumber,2017,0,"                      For horror hounds, Slumber may scratch a familiar itch but it ultimately fails to distinguish itself and, like most dreams, quickly fades from memory.                  "
Family Life,2017,64,                      Family Life is a fascinating and curious work that magnifies the way all of us misrepresent ourselves a little when we meet someone new and are interested in them.                  
Afterimage,2016,86,"                      'Afterimage' may be Strzemiński's bio-pic, but the images of endless breadlines, drafty hospital beds, and cigarette smoke hanging in the cold Polish air come across like memories tattooed on Wajda's brain.                  "
The Salesman,2016,96,                      Farhadi’s skillful treatment is anything but pointless and helps to prod our minds to think more about the film’s meaning.                  
Happy Hunting,2017,100,                      It was quite boring is what I'm trying to say.                  
Mohawk,2017,84,"                      Do yourself a favor and see this movie, then go and read and learn and be more understanding and compassionate with each other. We can watch this intense and charged movie and try and learn from our mistakes and be entertained while we do it.                  "
68 Kill,2017,70,"                      68 Kill is a horror-comedy-action thrill ride, one that goes for insane and then amps up the volume on that way past 11.                  "
Beach House,2018,25,                      Saltiel's conclusion feels ultimately preposterous and somewhat unsatisfying.                  
First Round Down,2016,20,"                      While the film has a lot going on, there's also a lot to like about it. As convoluted as the twisting plotlines are, it's easy to follow, and the action pushes us through the film from start to finish.                  "
Brotherhood,2016,61,                      Brotherhood makes for a gripping and fitting conclusion to Clarke's trilogy; this is a film that keeps you entertained while delivering a genuine and honourable message about taking responsibility for your actions and the people you love.                  
Wakefield,2016,72,"                      Cranston is excellent in the central role, with Garner (who deserves a more vibrant career) offering solid support.                  "
Retaliation,2017,76,"                      Yet the film does allow Bloom to stretch his range and to deliver two showboating monologues that demonstrate, if nothing else, that the narrative of his career is worth changing.                  "
The Shelter,2016,100,"                      It's a film full of questions and not very many clear answers, but it's very worth seeing as it's a well-crafted directorial debut made by a small team on a small budget which makes the most of it by looking and sounding great.                  "
Strange Weather,2016,56,"                      Indie road trip dramedies are a dime a dozen now, and aside from Hunter's performance, there's not much to distinguish this one from so many others.                  "
The Willoughbys,2020,91,"                      There's a taste of Roald Dahl, a hint of Despicable Me  and a dollop of Mary Poppins  , but, all spun together, they form a delightfully dark (but not too dark) story about finding the true value of family.                  "
Hostages,2017,90,"                      This hijacking thriller first establishes the social-historical backdrop with elegance and the characters' not-so-obvious motivation with confidence, before topping it all off with one of the most remarkable action set-pieces in recent European cinema.                  "
Operation Finale,2018,61,                      The film’s slow boil may push away those looking for a snappier or more action-oriented thriller.                   
The Wailing,2016,99,"                      Written and directed by Na Hong-jin, The Wailing is one of my favorite horror films. It’s deeply unsettling in how Na Hong-jin uses sound, imagery, time, and costuming to build a layered story...                  "
Scent,2014,89,"                      There's nothing as convincing as an Army vet talking to privileged prep school boys about boys in battle getting legs blown off, and how, when the bullets fly downrange, some boys run and some stand their ground. Every high schooler needs to see it.                  "
The Blackout Experiments,2016,45,"                      There's something here, but it's darker, and more elusive, than perhaps Fox even knows.                  "
White Fang,2018,80,                      Fang is a beautifully animated telling of the classic story all of us read in grade school.                  
Reach,2018,20,                      Reach is a thoroughly teen movie - its maturity and proficiency are outstripped by its desire and ambition.                  
The Eyes of My Mother,2016,79,"                      The Eyes of My Mother is really one of a kind. Each scene is meticulously crafted, and it is one where the chilling atmosphere lives in you. A unique directorial debut that shouldn't be overlooked.                   "
The Death and Life of Marsha P. Johnson,2017,97,                      This is a very effective piece about transphobia that adeptly weaves the story of a truly legendary icon with the problems still facing her community today.                  
Assimilate,2019,56,"                      made in the Trump era, a time when, no matter what your political persuasion, at least half the polarised country's populace appeared to have been replaced by sinister dead-eyed aliens, & neither neighbours nor family members could be trusted anymore                  "
Buddymoon,2016,75,"                      The film is fiction, but you can see the ties of a real friendship at work here, and that is part of the charm.                  "
How It Ends,2018,17,                      How It Ends is truly unique in the fact that it's the only disaster or post apocalypse film to leave me bored. The cinematic version of watching paint dry.                  
Blood Brother,2018,17,"                      Any self-respecting American would rather watch John Cena play a Rambo pastiche than watch Trey Songz do literally anything other than sing ""Can't Help But Wait.""                  "
Paterson,2016,96,"                      Jarmusch’s approach is minimalist yet subtly robust. His structure resembles stanzas of a poem, and they are filled with relaxed easygoing rhythms that sweep you through from start to finish.                  "
Person to Person,2017,52,"                      The old pan that something is ""less than the sum of its parts"" does not quite apply here.                  "
BLiND,2014,92,                      A riveting portrayal of human nature from first-time director Eskil Vogt...

The Bachelors,2017,80,                      Voelker’s story consistently surprised me especially in how deep it was willing to dive into the area of depression. I wasn’t expecting it. There are no soft perspectives or dulled edges.                  
Final Score,2018,69,                      The story? Could’ve been written by a cheap phone app.

Sanam Teri Kasam,2016,0,                      The makers of Sanam Teri Kasam are embarrassingly outdated in their thinking.                  
Indivisible,2016,91,"                      Invisibili is an emotionally powerful fill about the bonds between sisters and what can test them.

Trapped,2016,100,                      How these doctors and nurses manage to hold a smile as they deal with this lunacy is nothing short of saintly.                  
Plaza de la Soledad,2016,100,"                      A film that portrays love, sadness, joy and fear. The director achieves a complicity that can only occur among women. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
Bad Rap,2016,70,"                      [It] expounds on a nearly niche subject, coaxing out a vibrant story of four such rappers on the come up...                  "
The Untamed,2016,86,"                      The Untamed uses its sci-fi premise to explore grounded notions of masculinity, sexual repression and the all-consuming allure of unbridled sex to great effect.                    "
Our Time,2018,63,"                      [Writer-director Carlos] Reygadas is nothing if not ambitious-when he fails, he fails big.                  "
Generation Wealth,2018,46,"                      Greenfield wants us to know that greed, despite what Gordon Gekko so famously said, is not good.                  "
Chappaquiddick,2017,80,                      The true cleverness of “Chappaquiddick” is seen in how it moves with Kennedy’s evolving story in a way that by the end of the film we're still unclear on what’s the truth.                  
Journey to the West: The Demons Strike Back,2017,58,                      The kid friendly comical martial arts film draws only a smattering of laughs.                  
Eat That Question: Frank Zappa in His Own Words,2016,92,                      A stripped down portrait of an American original whose compositions expose as much about him as his words do. The real Frank Zappa? You'll see him with your ears.                  
Mapplethorpe: Look at the Pictures,2016,97,                      The most powerful way that Bailey and Barbato pay tribute to Mapplethorpe is by foregrounding his perspective.                  
Under the Gun,2016,100,"                      Rationally, Under the Gun makes an ironclad case for the need of legislation. Too bad most people react emotionally to the matter.                  "
The 4th,2016,50,"                      There's a struggle between the simplified overview of history, sort of a History 101 (a PBS specialty), and the deep dives into individual stories, which is when the series especially shines.                  "
Holy Hell,2016,75,"                      Though the filmmaker may ask himself whether enduring the personal nightmare of collecting footage for ""Holy Hell"" was worth it, it's certainly rewarding for an audience.                  "
Kiki,2016,83,"                      With its frank, moving storytelling and determination to bear witness to deep social fissures, the film is destined to secure a position on top-ten lists of gaymous cinema.                  "
The Lure,2015,89,                      Half the fun of this full-blown choreographed musical is that you can't believe what you are seeing. The other half is watching Golden dispatch leering drunks.                  
Sonita,2015,100,"                      Because I didn't follow Alizadeh's story as it happened live, the final third of Sonita played for me like a heist movie...                  "
Sky Ladder: The Art of Cai Guo-Qiang,2016,100,"                      For as tall as Cai imagines his latest effort will rise, the audience may actually feel as if they've been lifted even higher.                  "
Becoming Mike Nichols,2016,70,"                      However, the film feels only half-baked ...[and] ultimately feels like a part one on a much larger work with sequels that never came to pass.                  "
Dark Night,2016,62,"                      A matter-of-fact recapitulation, Dark Night isn't meant to entertain, but merely to convey, solemnly, the emptiness of contemporary connections.                  "
The Duelist,2016,43,                      I didn't care much for its grandiose self-seriousness and the dour focus on masculine honor above all else.                  
Loveless,2017,95,"                      Zvyagintsev's eulogy to humanity lost (...) an absence, rather than a presence. A dark jewel, which, when observed against the light, shows no reflection.                  "
Neerja,2016,100,                      It is easy to caricature villains. Making them relatable and believable in spite of their evil intentions is an effort few film writers make. Saiwyn does. Hats off to him for that.                  
Furlough,2018,20,"                      ""Furlough"" is funny and active, remaining compelling while it details small acts of connection and evasion.                  "
Eli,2019,48,                      Netflix's latest horror film is among its most surprising and entertaining.                  
Dreamland,2019,58,                      A screenplay with more zest to it or a twist in the tale would have made a difference.                  
All the Money in the World,2017,79,"                      It's a rollicking thriller through the worlds of oil tycoons, retired FBI agents and the moneyed masses of '70s Italy.                  "
After the Storm,2016,96,                      Kore-eda vividly explores the complexity of familial relations while touching gently upon the fundamental importance of treasuring small moments of happiness.                  
In Like Flynn,2018,48,                      Predominantly fizzy and shamelessly cheesy                  
Happy End,2017,70,"                      It's the late Trintignant who steals the show. His scene with young Harduin is so good. Bleak in the assessment of our present society which is grooming a generation that lacks empathy, Happy End is in line with other great Haneke films & just as strong.                  "
Dolls,2013,73,"                      Perhaps the best advice is, stop worrying about meaning. Sit back, enjoy its rich design, costumes, landscape and colours.                  "
Burden,2018,50,                      ...a film about Black suffering designed for white self-gratification.                  
Close,2019,37,                      This a straight-out action thriller and... I would say not one of the better ones.                  
Wish Upon,2017,19,"                      Wish Upon feels like the offspring of Are You Afraid of the Dark? and Final Destination, yet is content to remain a C student and coast on the success of its parents.                  "
Snapshots,2018,71,"                      Though some of its flaws feel like rather amateur stumbles, Snapshots is clearly well-meaning and keenly felt.                  "
Here Come the Videofreex,2015,100,                      Extraordinary stranger-than-fiction story.                  
Boo! A Madea Halloween,2016,19,                      Boo! A Madea Halloween is a movie that shouldn't exist.

United States of Love,2016,85,"                      United States of Love fluctuates between frustrating, shocking and alienating its audience through its pace, content and stylisation.                  "
Yarn,2016,78,"                      Though imperfectly woven together, Yarn is a soothing and occasionally insightful watch.                  "
Reset,2017,71,"                      For the uninitiated, the film never truly articulates just how Mr. Millepied's criticism of the company's archaic traditions - which ultimately led to the fallout - could be perceived as arrogant, incendiary or disrespectful.                  "
The Stray,2017,40,                      There is no doubt The Stray has its heart in the right place and that gets it far.                  
The Wolf Hour,2019,48,"                      It draws out an exceptional performance from Watts as she sweats, shudders and strives to sustain the film for its full duration by herself...But the film really inspires more yawns than scares.                  "
The Best Democracy Money Can Buy,2016,50,"                      Palast's dogged detective work is solid and shocking in its revelations, but he blunts his lance somewhat by hamming it up as a fedora-wearing noir sleuth.                  "
The Midwife,2017,88,"                      It takes some time for 'The Midwife' to get there, and when it does, it does so quietly. But with Deneuve and Frot as traveling companions, at least you know the destination will be worth it.                  "
Phantom of the Opera,2014,76,"                      The cinematography remains gorgeous to this day, and the sets are pretty. It is a picture of opulence. On that front, the film remains a success                  "
Bruce,2019,0,"                      The laughs could have been spread out a bit more and not all at once, which would make the film not feel as if it was dragging. Bruce!!! is one hour and forty-three minutes but feels more like two hours or over. It's the case where less is more.                  "
Starless Dreams,2016,100,"                      Starless Dreams doesn't offer much hope, but it is a compelling portrait of girls whose dreams darken with their years.                  "
The Hatton Garden Job,2017,18,                      Stay as far away as you can.                  
Drone,2017,27,"                      Goes off on a few too many tangents, but its core theme comes through by the time the credits roll. Whether its worth waiting for it to hit though is a different story.                  "
The Hurricane Heist,2018,47,"                      ...the story is so silly and inconsequential, functioning mostly to move from one weather-action scene to the next.                  "
Mary Magdalene,2018,44,"                      What we're left with, sadly, is a frustrating quasi-biopic that never quite gets a grip on its subject matter.                  "
Wind River,2017,88,                      Sheridan’s direction matches his screenwriting – steady and assured. His knack for pacing keeps the story bumping along all while building tension and fleshing out his characters.

Permission,2017,67,                      Although uneven it is an interesting look at the responsibilities that come with adult relationships.                  
The Network,2012,67,                      Marginally insightful and incomplete while lacking in additional perspectives.                  
Detroit,2017,82,
The Comeback Trail,2020,32,"                      It's my hunch that the original was marginally more rewarding because expectations would have been lower without big name stars who agreed, for some reason or another, to take part in this remake.                  "
Walking Out,2017,90,"                      The film’s title makes the impending peril obvious, but the buildup of the two main characters and their strained relationship gives form to the danger once it hits.                   "
"Love, Gilda",2018,89,"                      D'Apolito presents a straightforward biographical documentary with Love, Gilda. She at once mourns the loss of an effervescent life cut short by a cruel disease, and she suggests that Gilda lived her life to the fullest.                  "
The Miracle Season,2018,52,"                      In the end, nonetheless, this salute to Line's legacy offers uplifting entertainment suitable for a broad audience.                  "

Official Secrets,2019,82,                      Official Secrets' unshowy craftmanship is persuasive in its building of suspense.                  
Tomcat,2016,56,"                      With its story actually quite interesting, a ruthless editor is all that would have been needed to turn this into a fantastic film.                  "
Bang! The Bert Berns Story,2016,100,"                      As documentaries go, Bang! is fairly by the numbers but comes to life when the artists that performed for Berns share their stories on this eccentric and unique figure.                  "

Ugh.                  "
Colette,2018,87,"                      Everything happens in a documentary capsule, one of mourning, of crying let loose, of memory, but above all, of Resistance. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
Life,2017,67,"                      I’m sure some of its logic could be picked apart if you’re into that kind of thing, but I enjoyed it as a taut, white-knuckle space thriller that looks great and absolutely nails it’s ending. That’s enough for me.                  "
24 Hours to Live,2017,52,"                      With high speed chases, explosions and one head-scratching scene where the local militia bring knives to a gun-fight, this movie will appeal to those who like non-stop action.                  "
Homo Sapiens,2016,100,"                      Geyrhalter piques the imagination with images of decay: towns, malls, theaters, and hospitals, all deserted, unnamed, and overrun by foliage and wildlife.                  "
American Satan,2017,78,"                      At a trim 72 minutes, An American Satan delivers a cursory if colorful sketch...                  "

The Prime Ministers: Soldiers and Peacemakers,2015,29,                      The cumulative effect of the Soldiers & Peacemakers' straight-forward and blunt narration of linear history is a film only slightly less dry than matzoh.                  
Kaabil,2017,58,                      The world is neatly stacked between the very good and the extremely bad. There is no scope for any in-betweenness of being. Then there are dialogues from another era...                  
Ideal Home,2018,68,"                      Several lines and moments remain memorable and laugh-out-loud funny, regardless of its transparent ambitions as a socially progressive comedy.                  "
The Clapper,2017,23,"                      The Clapper is a comedy that doesn't totally know what it wants to be, a commentary on fame and class or a romantic comedy. What we end up with is something that never really does both well and ends up hampering each theme.                  "
Mom and Dad,2017,75,                      A twisted horror-comedy without much beyond its back-of-the-box description.                  
Abundant Acreage Available,2017,80,"                      MacLachlan has a way of reducing his characters and, by his extension, viewers to children, as a way to keenly elicit our empathies, but at the risk of having his film feel too rudimentary.                  "
Deadpool 2,2018,84,"                      Although less cohesive and more meandering than the first, it's an entertaining sequel that pushes the franchise forward.                  "
Kill Switch,2017,9,"                      Stevens and the other actors are quite good, but the film doesn't quite match their abilities.                  "

Psychopaths,2017,24,"                      The thing needs more moments of quiet, more time to ruminate and stew in its own filth. It doesn't help that Phillips' narration is pretty much constant and the score is hugely grating.                  "
Strike a Pose,2016,95,"                      But this doc does address the complicated nature of who Madonna is and what the legacy of Truth or Dare is, and it is essential viewing for that, and for letting these dancers tell their stories.                  "
Barry,2016,80,                      Biased and showy hero worship is rightfully absent for a solid biography slice.                  
The Little Mermaid,2018,20,"                      Creaky visual effects, slapdash plotting and a script drunk on cliché: There's pretty much nothing but cheap parlor trickery here.                  "
Homegrown: The Counter-Terror Dilemma,2016,100,"                      Homegrown: The Counter-Terror Dilemma provocatively examines the question of what makes a homegrown jihadist. There is no easy answer, of course.                  "

Samaritan,2022,39,"                      The movie can sometimes get boring, but it’s not a bad choice if you’ve been missing the violence of an aging action hero.                   "
Border,2018,97,"                      The mysteries of Border reveal themselves slowly from here, but each one ratchets up the film's stakes in a delightful manner.                  "
Disturbing the Peace,2016,100,                      The film's boldness matches the bravery and thoughtfulness of the subjects being profiled. It also offers considerable hope for future generations.                  
Hustlers,2019,87,                      “Hustlers” is a fairly basic crime drama that plays around with some good ideas but ultimately can’t quite get out of its own way.

Ghost Stories,2017,85,"                      It definitely molds itself some way completely different and gives a great, great payoff.                  "
Hope Springs Eternal,2018,88,"                      There's enough sweetness between the blurry lines to make the slight running time of 78 minutes feel like a breeze. Maybe when you're dealing with subject matter as depressing as this, the best route is to put some sheen over it.                  "
Bright,2017,26,"                      Bright is certainly an attractive prospect given the talent involved, but Ayer's aggressive and ultramasculine perspective feels tired and, perhaps, outdated.                  "
Mondays with William,2013,40,                      Mildly engaging. It appeals more to the heart than to the mind.

Versus: The Life and Films of Ken Loach,2016,100,"                      The director's early days are thoroughly detailed here; if his later career is rushed over, an impressive trawl of talking heads (Gabriel Byrne, Cillian Murphy) keeps thing lively.                  "
Private Life,2018,93,"                      This movie gives us a taste of everything, though thankfully resisting the urge to be too tragic and lament the woe that is womanhood.                  "
Everybody Loves Somebody,2017,89,"                      [It] is not a revolutionary film by any stretch, nor is it likely to draw anyone who isn't already interested in the romance genre, but it has a charm and wit of its own that places it a head above much of the competition.                  "
Sundowners,2017,73,                      This is a messy attempt to invoke The Hangover and fuse it with Wedding Crashers.                  
The Polka King,2017,67,"                      Its Blacks movie, and his polished stage-mugging is used to great effect, just as his general likability will have you rooting for this not-quite-victimless-crime and the open-hearted, if devious, criminal behind it.                  "

Shock and Awe,2017,30,                      Movie has its heart in the right place but isn't angry or intrepid enough.                  
To the Bone,2017,70,                      Poor acting and a muddied plot are the least of this contentious Netflix drama's problems.                  
Backtrack,2016,29,"                      Backtrack, whatever it cost, feels costly, bloated, crammed with screaming CG ghosties that pop out at the screen screaming when the director needs to goose us                  "
Longing,2017,75,"                      [Actor] Shai Avivi... has enough versatility to fulfill what this curious script demands: to move from drama to comedy from one moment to another, often within the same scene. [Full review in Spanish]                  "

Whitney: Can I Be Me,2017,87,"                      If its grip on important facts is slippery, Whitney: Can I Be Me gives a fascinating look at the making of a popstar before the age of social media.                  "
The Good Liar,2019,63,"                      Although some moments aren't for the faint of heart, The Good Liar is certainly worthy of a watch.                  "

Much Ado About Nothing,2011,90,                      Much Ado About Nothing is one of the few movies of recent years that could leave its audiences weeping with joy.                  
Nerdland,2016,21,"                      The A-list actors and well known cast -- with the exception of Hannibal Buress -- can't save the jokes, the astounding sourness of which suppresses any trace of wit.                  "
Clemency,2019,92,"                      Alfre Woodard stuns in the harrowing and affecting death row drama... her performance is a masterclass in quietly conveying the slow, steady grounding down of Bernadine’s humanity.                  "
"I, Tonya",2017,90,"                      Margot Robbie and director Craig Gillespie do the impossible: they turn Tonya Harding, 1994's most vilified American, into a sympathetic figure.  My #2 movie of 2017.                  "
The Hate U Give,2018,97,                      George Tillman Jr. works with a lot of moving parts and manages them with an able hand.                  
The Shape of Water,2017,92,                      There is no subtlety whatsoever. You can practically hear del Toro beating his pulpit through much of Shannon’s dialogue.

The Invisibles,2017,71,"                      It always feels a little awkward and a little jumpy, but the stories themselves are fascinating.                  "
The Beguiled,2017,78,"                      The Southern Gothic vibe is almost immediately noticeable. Both look and tone convey a subtle sense of isolation and unease.

Laal Rang,2016,56,"                      The Haryanvi dialect (I often wished for subtitles), production design and locations add to the authenticity. Sadly, the script takes its time setting up the tension and conflict...                  "
Fullmetal Alchemist,2017,28,"                      ""Fullmetal Alchemist"" is an impressive film to look at (minus the blond wigs), but unfortunately, in terms of narrative, characters, and adapting is a mediocre effort.                  "
"Juliet, Naked",2018,83,"                      Of all of Hornby’s works, Juliet, Naked is by far handled with the most care. Lightly funny while packed with melancholy along the way.                  "
Tully,2018,87,"                      It begins as a natural and honest showcase about the struggle of mothers and women but loses its integrity with an obvious, writerly choice that reeks of artificiality.                  "
Imitation Girl,2017,88,"                      [A]side from Carter's performance and Travis Tips's cinematography, the film is pretty much forgettable.                  "
Mobile Homes,2017,59,"                      Boasts interesting cinematography, an elegiac score but unfortunately, despite the flashes of interest, the film is more interested in misery than solid drama.                  "
Mid90s,2018,80,"                      There is a rawness to the film that is reminiscent of Larry Clark’s Kids. Although it is not as extreme or exploitative, it is honest in its portrayal of youth culture at the time.                  "

A Very Sordid Wedding,2017,86,"                      Although far from the sordid affair the title suggests, this joyously camp film is a definite guilty pleasure that will be a flat out triumph to returning fans- and an enjoyably trashy time for newcomers to the franchise.                  "
The Ritual,2017,74,                      Giving the tried and tested Blair Witch formula a Hangover face lift - sans the comedy - The Ritual is a highly effective shocker.

Phantom of the Theatre,2016,50,"                      While unlikely to challenge the spooky classics of the past, it's a very respectable genre offering from China, even more so given the situation with the anti-horror censors                  "
The Unseen,2017,68,"                      On the whole, Amaurosis is a uniquely painful experience whose emotional trauma lingers even after it's reached its end.                  "
Social Animals,2018,88,"                      While spotlighting the Instagram journeys of three fascinating young people, this documentary fails to ask the most important questions.                  "
The King,2017,86,"                      ""The King"" is a great movie, which reminded me of Scorsese's days of glory, and a film that proves that Godard was right when he was saying "" It's not where you take things from - it's where you take them to"".                  "

On the Road,2016,50,"                      The film stops being about the band and becomes about what their work means. Not all Winterbottom's experiments pay off, but this one absolutely does.                  "
Growing Up Coy,2016,100,"                      If you're a trans person, this battle might be all too familiar to you and you might not get a lot of out of this documentary, but if you're looking to learn and feel for trans people, Growing Up Coy is a good option.                  "
Thoroughbreds,2017,87,                      A half-batty movie that takes the problems of the young and privileged and gives them a violent shake. Where do all the pieces land? You’ll have to watch to find out.                  
The Florida Project,2017,96,"                      It’s superficially less bleak than Tangerine, rendered by Baker in tropical colours, but poverty lurks throughout.                  "
Breaking News,2012,79,"                      Johnnie To's direction is once more impressive, particularly the way he stages and shoots the action, taking full advantage of the narrow corridors of the building the gang has taken a stand in                  "
Camera Obscura,2017,26,"                      Mostly pays off its ambiguous and psychological premise but feels unsure of itself, keeping itself too vague to its own detriment...there's nothing the film really does wrong, so if the concept sounds interesting, you're sure to enjoy it.                  "
My Journey Through French Cinema,2016,100,"                      All told, there's nothing self-indulgent about this series as Tavernier rarely mentions his own films, other than 2002's Safe Conduct.                  "
Saturday Church,2017,93,"                      The two styles -- naturalistic drama and extravagant musical -- coexist a little awkwardly in the same movie, but the result is heartfelt and original.                  "
To Hell and Back: The Kane Hodder Story,2017,100,"                      To Hell and Back should prove to be a surprise for many horror fans, as well as individuals who may not be quite so familiar with Hodder's work.                  "
The Hero,2017,77,"                      While the film is a journeyman effort, The Hero's love for Elliott shines through in every scene. If you want to see an oft-supporting player get his due, this is the film.                  "
Every Day,2016,63,                      it's refreshing to see a movie about an issue as narratively complex as this that doesn't get itself tied in knots about it.                  
Barracuda,2017,92,"                      Where the script leaves the character of Merle a shell, Tolman picks up the slack in her subtle and often heartbreaking performance.                  "
The River Thief,2016,0,                      A hoary melodrama revealing the filmmaker's inexperience.                  
Infinity Baby,2017,76,"                      Infinity Baby essentially works best as a character study for the type of over-the-top blowhard normally thrown into a supporting role, as if Silicon Valley's Erlich Bachman or Community's Pierce got to star in a perverse sitcom.                  "
Sun Dogs,2017,80,"                      At some point, fairly early on, it stops being cute.                  "

Generational Sins,2017,33,                      In the end none of it adds up to much.                  
The Charmer,2017,92,"                      Alami's directorial style is line with the subtle yet suspenseful realism reminiscent of such contemporary Iranian filmmakers as Asghar Farhadi (A Separation, The Salesman) and Majid Barzegar (Parviz, A Very Ordinary Citizen).                  "
Traffik,2018,27,"                      It exploits for entertainment the trauma it claims to shed a light on -- and it isn't even entertaining on its own terms, much less well made.                  "
The Orphanage,2019,91,"                      Fantastical scenes of the more idyllic or proactive life Quodrat dreams of are interspersed like scenes from one of the movies he loves, and it is this visual expression of his inner life that reveals to viewers the suffering and grief...                  "
Puppet Master: The Littlest Reich,2018,70,                      A film so deliciously silly and outrageously inappropriate that it's impossible not to be carried along by its madness.                  
Boundaries,2018,49,"                      Even before Boundaries' tired plot grinds into motion, your patience may already be worn thin by the introduction of only the first of its many grating characters.                  "
The Corrupted,2019,30,                      It's a better than decent thriller that you can catch on your telly.                  
Golden Exits,2017,67,                      Perry's aesthetic choice are also designed to obscure clarity. The film is grainy-warmly and beautifully so-while the sound design is such that everything is more or less at the level of room tone.                  
Sorry to Bother You,2018,93,                      Stanfield’s talent is undeniable; a method actor at heart and now should become a household name.                  
Alex Strangelove,2018,81,"                      As Netflix Sunday afternoon sofa-coma fluff goes, this is like a nice glass of cool lemonade; the problem is, Love, Simon is more like a strawberry daiquiri, decorated with an umbrella AND a sparkler.                  "
Killing Gunther,2017,46,"                      It's almost impressive how a movie that's supposed to be a comedy, one directed, written, and acted by comedic performers, fails to generate a single moment of humor.                  "
Trouble,2017,50,"                      The constant bickering becomes tedious pretty quickly, and the screenplay isn't dramatically compelling enough to fill the gaps.                  "
Mom,2017,67,"                      Relevant, riveting and oddly rousing despite its grim theme.                  "
Machines,2016,93,"                      The film doesn't only depict the everyday working conditions of the hundreds of manual laborers, but also captures it in a startlingly clear, beautiful imagery.                  "
Ophelia,2018,62,"                      Not everything in the film works, but Daisy Ridley is terrific, sets and costumes are beautiful, plus just the idea of the mysterious Ophelia telling her own version is irresistible.                  "
Show Dogs,2018,16,"                      There are at least 15 dog movies on Netflix and Miss Congeniality and you can watch all of them in the month free trial, rather than spend money to watch that piece of dog excrement that is Show Dogs.                  "

Cats,2019,19,                      It is unlikely anyone will be feline good after witnessing this cat-astrophe because ultimately it was the morbid curiosity that killed the Cats…                  
Euphoria,2017,19,                      Assisted death is an issue ripe for drama and yet the movie sidesteps every opportunity for depth with the kind of fake solemnity favored by undertakers.                  
The Girl Without Hands,2016,95,"                      The film feels like a more faithful version of the Grimm Brothers than we usually get from the edge-sanding Disney adaptations, but it ultimately cares more about splashing around in a pool of hippy-dippy aloofness than developing strong characters.

Starfish,2018,87,"                      Sometimes a little too music-video-like, and playfully random...I couldn't relate. Still, many millennial viewers seem to think Starfish is amaaaaaazing.                  "
God Bless the Broken Road,2018,17,"                      God Bless the Broken Road, if you didn't know already, is a powerfully stupid movie, crafted with all the panache of a workplace training video.                  "
The Mimic,2020,62,"                      The cast hits their marks, and [Thomas] Mazziotti keeps predictability at bay, but it's tough to shake the feeling that it all would've worked better as a short...                  "
Marie Curie: The Courage of Knowledge,2016,65,"                      Being Polish and a woman, Marie perseveres against all obstacles in the male-dominated French scientific establishment.                  "

The Killing of a Sacred Deer,2017,80,"                      Lanthimos steeps The Killing of a Sacred Deer in menacing subtext and substance, never approaching a scene the way you expect, never allowing the viewer to guess what will happen next.                  "
Thumper,2017,88,"                      Thumper fails because Ross forgets that the reason cinema is so good at sending messages is because it engenders empathy and, in order to do that, we need to care about the characters as people...                  "
Breathe,2017,68,                      Breathe will bring a lump to the throat with its passionate but un-showy telling of two individuals who sought to change the status quo.                  
Disturbing the Peace,2020,19,                      Even Guy Pearce can’t make us buy some of his lines and his MacGyver-styled action is an even harder sell. He seems utterly bored throughout the entire proceedings which is completely understandable.                  
The Dark,2018,89,"                      The Dark is a horror movie that faces the real horrors of abuse that too many are familiar with. It is slow at times, demanding a little patience from the viewer, but it is worth it.                  "
Small Crimes,2017,59,                      Too many moments that should play as darkly-funny just don't.

Just Getting Started,2017,4,"                      The producers must think this drivel is what their senior target audience wants, but only someone who's lost an appetite for real life could find any entertainment in it.                  "
Fraud,2016,78,"                      At 52-minutes, it's not long enough to feel particularly substantive, and seeing it on the big screen can be a little disorienting, but Fraud possesses a hypnotic pull that's hard to deny.                  "
Endless,2020,21,"                      The film isn’t a new classic by any means, but thanks to the commitment to its central premise and the moving performance by Alexandra Shipp, it’s one that won’t be an embarrassing guilty pleasure in another decade or so.                  "
Wheelman,2017,88,"                      Written and directed with precise skill and determination by Jeremy Rush, you wouldn't dare guess this was his first movie.                  "
At the Fork,2016,100,                      A remarkably intelligent case for the humane treatment of farm animals only marred by the inclusion of Whole Foods CEO who exploits prison labor for products in his grocery stores.                  
Sour Grapes,2016,96,"                      The film leaves us with some frustrating lingering questions about who Rudy Kurniawan really was, although the journey is no less enjoyable for it.                  "
Master,2016,80,"                      Master is entertaining, and though flawed it's a solid piece of commercial cinema, and fans of the cast and anti-establishment thrillers should find plenty to enjoy                  "
The Garden,2013,79,"                      It's easy to tell what side the filmmaker takes, which leads to unanswered questions... [Director Scott Hamilton] Kennedy's compelling documentary is quite thorough otherwise.                  "

Whitney,2018,88,                      Kevin Macdonald manages to make a film that’s both a tribute and a tragic tale of the cost of fame.                  
Jailbreak,2017,64,                      Fans of fight films should be entertained somewhat with the first half of the film but most will eventually get bored with the same fights in a rinse and repeat pattern.                  
You Were Never Really Here,2017,89,                      It was my second viewing that I was able to fall in with the film’s unique rhythms.

Step,2017,96,"                      The reason Step works so well is that you can actually see life paths shifting before you eyes. They put in the work on and off the team, and the results happen.                  "
Skyscraper,2018,48,"                      There is also a strong message of family that I responded to. Again, at times cheesy, but still a welcomed ingredient.                  "

Underwater,2020,48,"                      It might not reinvent the wheel but unlike the drilling that initiates the accident, it is neither deep nor boring.

An Interview with God,2018,60,"                      A compelling faith-based drama that deals with its subjects and its characters seriously, without resorting to exploitative sermonising.                  "
The Nest,2016,60,"                      Sisters is one of those comedies that ends with a series of outtakes over the end credits, and by the looks of it, the talent had more fun shooting the film than we did watching it.                   "
Machine,2017,0,"                      Jokes aside, this is a joke of a film.                  "
Reset,2016,71,"                      For the uninitiated, the film never truly articulates just how Mr. Millepied's criticism of the company's archaic traditions - which ultimately led to the fallout - could be perceived as arrogant, incendiary or disrespectful.                  "

Running with the Devil,2019,24,"                      There's a lot going on in Running With the Devil, but also somehow absolutely nothing at all. It jumbles together too many storylines, drug movie clichés, flat characters, and an epic cast of B-movie all stars.                  "
Gemini,2017,71,                      The overall tedium gives one plenty of time to imagine and wish for this trio in a far more worthy vehicle.                  
This Changes Everything,2018,88,"                      In its technical simplicity, This Changes Everything raises the problem of gender injustice rooted in the past and all-embracing the contemporary age.                  "
This Time Tomorrow,2016,90,"                      Straightforward direction and simplistic storytelling create a moving look at the minutiae of everyday life, but makes for an ultimately slow moving-going experience.                  "
Room for Rent,2017,88,"                      With a supporting cast of local actors - Tom Anniko, John B. Lowe, Ernesto Griffith, Adriana O'Neil among them - the film is a decent quirky comedy that rises above a support-your-local-film-industry rationale to go see it.                  "
Thirst Street,2017,75,"                      A short, simple film that nails its aesthetic and provides a compelling tale of how someone psychologically unwell can confuse obsession for love.                  "
Opening Night,2017,83,"                      Anchored by an engaging turn by Topher Grace as Nick, a failed Broadway performer turned stage manager, the film, directed by Isaac Rentz from a script by Gerry De Leon and Greg Lisi, packs plenty of music and mischief into its brief running time.                  "
I Am Not Your Negro,2016,99,"                      Though it may limit discussion of Baldwin’s sexuality to a singular passing reference, the 2017 documentary still offers an essential and compelling peek into one of our nation’s most impressive minds.                  "
Let There Be Light,2017,100,"                      ... instead of a lecture, the film focuses on the people doing the science, mindful of the unexpected collisions that result when geniuses bounce off one another.                  "
Brigsby Bear,2017,82,"                      Director Dave McCary has made an adorable film, celebrating ingenuity, and ones passion for creativity.                  "
Abe,2019,71,"                      It’s an enjoyable watch, but it’s missing that one ingredient that could take it to the next level.                  "
Charlotte,2021,69,"                      The animation is merely passable, never achieving the beauty of Charlotte’s own art, and it runs into the common biopic issue of being more a sequence of events rather than a propulsive narrative.                  "
Tread,2020,92,                      It was an interesting watch but I think it could have been more viewer friendly. I wish they had explored more ways to visually showcase this wild story.                  
The Nun,2018,25,                      But then you get to the storytelling which slowly sucks out the film’s potential.                   
The Party,2017,82,"                      Sally Potter's scathing social satire The Party, shot in black and white in three claustrophobic rooms is a gem, and thankfully short given the compression of nerves and tears and emotion.                  "
Guardians,2017,33,                      Guardians is a comedy that runs on the dark side of things and works great while doing so.                  
Band Aid,2017,88,"                      Zoe Lister-Jones successfully navigates a difficult tone, making a heartfelt, musically-driven romantic dramedy, that doesn't exist in either drama or comedy for too long.                  "
Santoalla,2016,85,                      A rewarding human interest documentary.                  
For Now,2017,83,"                      Barlow also conceived the story she co-writes (with Senes and Katherine Du Bois), while adding an attractive on-screen presence that resembles a mix of the young Shelley Long and Zooey Deschanel.                  "
The Kitchen,2019,23,"                      It’s almost shocking how lifeless, bland, and even pointless this comic book adaptation’s dialogue is, only matched by its lazy, anemic plot twist.                  "
Burning Sands,2017,88,                      We want movies to make us feel things and generate discussions. This movie succeeded in both.                  
A Hidden Life,2019,82,"                      Malick gives us a three-dimensional portrait of a rare type of hero, told through a true story of faith, family, and the unquenchable human spirit in the face of tremendous persecution.                  "
Camp Cold Brook,2018,57,                      Come to camp but skip the swim lessons.                  
Fun Mom Dinner,2017,32,"                      As with any terrible comedy, the biggest problem with Fun Mom Dinner is that it just isn't funny.                  "
Mary,2019,4,"                      Interesting, but not original. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
The Last Movie Star,2017,59,                      Rifkin has made a very clever turn for Reynolds- whom he obviously adores- in Dog Years.                  
Head Full of Honey,2018,0,"                      One of the worst films of 2018. Maudlin, clunky, contrived and painfully unfunny. A total misfire. The actors deserve better.                  "
The Work,2017,100,"                      Stretched out to nearly an hour and a half, its intensity is diluted and it can feel a little repetitive.                  "
Rat Film,2016,90,"                      [Director Theo Anthony's] approach is formal, poetic, and associative, but ultimately thin, strained, and incoherent.                  "
The Competition,2018,17,"                      Predictable romcom has lots of drinking, some stereotypes.                  "
One Night Only,2016,57,"                      Though frustratingly let down, for this reviewer at least, by a bungled and melodramatic conclusion, it's a film with plenty to enjoy                  "
The Pulitzer at 100,2016,22,"                      Lightweight and self-congratulatory, but with talent like this, at least it is entertaining.                  "
The Stakelander,2016,80,"                      The Stakelander is slightly repetitive and may not completely stack up to the first’s modest charms, but is definitely worth spending another eighty quick minutes with.                  "
River Runs Red,2018,22,"                      River Runs Red is a film that is about a very serious issue but tends to sometimes take a campy approach to it. I could have done without a few of the scenes, but it was a pretty good story with a cast that makes the film work.                  "
Kings,2017,13,"                      Even as pure dramatization, ""Kings"" is an irresponsibly aimless one.                  "
Hal,2018,90,                      Ashby experienced an outburst of creativity and social criticism under the influence of the broad popular radicalization in the late 1960s and early 1970s.                  
Total Recall,2010,31,                      [The film] spends so much of its time trying to duplicate aspects of the original that the filmmakers were distracted from their most clever ideas.                  
The Big Bad Fox and Other Tales,2017,97,"                      This is ideal viewing for young children, though animation fans of all ages should find much to admire.                  "
The Future,2011,72,                      Somehow there is narration by a cat wearing a little cast on its leg and it is a beautiful and a heartbreaking thing                  
The Atoning,2017,67,                      A thoughtful and insightful documentary that shows the power of communication as well as depicting the aftermath of a traumatic event and the effects of cult mentality.                  
Lucky,2017,97,"                      Lucky is a lovely, small film. It's an ode to living. A farewell to a well-lived life, and an acceptance of what comes after.                  "
Yardie,2018,54,"                      Tonally uneven, too slow at some points and too speedy at others; it makes for an okay, if rather forgettable watch.                  "
The Laundromat,2019,41,"                      It's like Where's Waldo sporting all the other [famous] people in this film... it's all fun, it works.                   "
The Adventurers,2017,14,"                      The Adventurers is not a terrible film. It is, however, a crushingly average one.                  "
The Empty Man,2020,77,                      The most terrifying thing about The Empty Man's story is that nihilism eventually wins the day.                   
Sisters,2016,60,"                      Sisters is one of those comedies that ends with a series of outtakes over the end credits, and by the looks of it, the talent had more fun shooting the film than we did watching it.                   "
Strong Island,2017,100,"                      What Ford is trying to do with Strong Island is make his family's history visible once again, to give it the clarity and focus that were taken away. Through this process, the wounds of the past might be healed.                  "
The Student,2017,87,"                      Ironically allows antireligious pedagogics and dogmas overtake [Kirill Serebrennikov's] story, itself a cautionary tale on the dangers of pedagogical and dogmatic thinking.                  "
Limbo,1999,72,"                      Sharply uneven, John Sayles' 12th film features many of his thematic motifs but the ambiguous ending is problematic.                  "
No Alternative,2018,83,                      Cavazos -- who has the swagger and punk rock pose of a young Sarah Silverman -- is a revelation.                  
Elizabeth Blue,2017,58,                      And yet there's always a feeling that something is off in Elizabeth Blue. Some aspects are almost too idyllic and leave the audience asking certain questions that only grow more and more as the film progresses.                  
Bodied,2017,89,                      A wildly original exploration of bad taste and cultural sensitivity.                  
Esteros,2016,100,"                      While the movie is not without flaws, its simplicity is elevated by beautiful cinematography and production value.                  "
David Crosby: Remember My Name,2019,92,"                      Transcends the usual rock doc career retrospective to create an unflinching portrait of the man one bandmate called ""insufferable.""                  "
First Kill,2017,15,"                      The set-up promises a lean slice of genre filmmaking. Unfortunately, the plot is overstretched and overwrought, with director Steven C Miller taking time out from the action to hit us in the face with symbolism and irony.                  "
I Am Vengeance,2018,38,                      The Britishness of I Am Vengeance is probably its second greatest strength behind Bennett himself.                  
Escape Room,2019,50,"                      You learn early on to switch your brain off, but even that can’t cover the ludicrous finale.                   "
The Runner,2021,31,"                      Rooted thoroughly in its protagonist’s introspection, The Runner makes up for what it lacks in thriller pacing with an ambitious depth of fraughtness.                  "
Life and Nothing More,2017,93,                      Esparza's updated take on neo-realism encompasses striking use of nonprofessional actors whose work could hardly be improved upon.                  
Nana,2012,67,"                      Driven by a combination of narrative economy and emotional expansiveness, Valrie Massadian's ""Nana"" is as difficult to pin down as the inner life of the tiny human at its center.                  "
Age of Summer,2018,50,"                      There's plenty of sun and fun, but it's Kiely's presentation of a teen finding his bliss that makes Age of Summer a disarmingly pleasant diversion.                  "
Summer 1993,2017,100,"                      This is a painful and powerful film about grief, fitting in, and family.                  "
Safari,2016,100,"                      Through death we are all reborn, and this is made all the more clearer within Safari with tableaus of people standing in front of walls of their hunting trophies.                  "
Hunting Season,2017,100,"                      Despite there being something really generic about the script, Garagiola knows that the best way to portray the complexities of the story is through her actors. [Full Review in Spanish]                  "
Iceman,2017,83,                      Too conventional to be of much interest.                  
Yourself and Yours,2016,94,"                      Yourself and Yours, much funnier and seemingly breezy, really sticks around, its numerous complications and contradictions needling at the brain and refusing to settle on any one interpretation.                  "
Augie,2018,71,                      Augie will resonate most deeply with those who appreciate overcoming bordering on high inspiration films.                  
Tunnel,2016,100,                      Fantastic survival drama-type film.                  
The House of Tomorrow,2017,75,"                      Fine but not especially inspired. Still, seeing this gifted group of actors together, making the most of a fairly pedestrian screenplay, is enjoyable enough.                  "
Spitfire,2018,94,                      The evolution of the legendary fighter and the crucial role it played in pushing back against the might of Hitler's Wehrmacht - which had already conquered the skies of Europe - is chronicled in this dutifully crafted tribute. War buffs will love it.                  
Wounds,2019,47,"                      It's not precisely terrible -- these are all talented people involved. It's just one or two degrees off from working, but those one or two degrees, with a project this high-wire, defeats it.                  "
I Am Not Madame Bovary,2016,83,"                      Paired with a complex performance from lead actress Bingbing Fan, an otherwise slight, arguably trite narrative makes this sharply observed beauty of a film all the more bitter and brittle.                  "
Unlovable,2018,82,                      Hard to love but easy to admire.                  
Werewolf,2016,92,"                      Ashley McKenzie... she crafts a quietly devastating story of addiction, recovery, and relapse that portrays its subjects with both compassion and blunt honesty.                  "
Wildlife,2018,94,"                      “Wildlife” has such a strong emotional core, and even as a fiery metaphor burns on the horizon (I’ll let you discover it for yourselves) the film never loses its heart.                  "
Before the Flood,2016,75,"                      The result is an emotional film, modestly directed by Fisher Stevens, that examines the issue on both a highly personal and global scale.                  "
Jesus,2016,79,"                      [A]n obviously intelligent filmmaker, [Guzzoni] reaches the core of the inner darkness directly and without any concessions towards the viewer. [Full Review in Spanish]                  "
Permanent,2017,44,"                      Both bizarre and charming, the sincerity of Permanent is refreshingly sweet and a timeless take on coming-of-age.                  "
"Ben-Gurion, Epilogue",2016,100,"                      It is an often-mocked image, but it is explained here in terms of someone, even in their 80s, looking for change wherever one can find it. It may not be a bad idea to embrace other perspectives no matter where they come from.                  "
Dirty Laundry,2012,50,"                      run of the mill, with a few good laughs along the way                  "
Glory,2016,94,"                      If SLAVA proves anything, it is that corruption doesn't need absolute power: large scale indifference and selfishness can start a deep rot that spreads.                  "
Anatomy of Violence,2016,43,                      I just feel that this film would be better served - as we know that Mehta is capable of doing - as a narrative film instead of an acting exercise.                  
Mystify: Michael Hutchence,2019,100,                      A touching tribute to one of music's most misunderstood showmen...                  
Miss Bala,2019,21,"                      “Miss Bala” lacks the edge you would expect from this type of movie, and its story plays out in the most implausible way.                  "
Styx,2018,93,"                      A stern attack on Europe's apathy towards a calamity rooted in colonialism, Fischer's breakout festival hit is a visceral, disquieting experiment that speaks volumes about white guilt and premeditated institutional negligence.                  "
Freaky Ali,2016,33,                      It's entirely on the writers and actors to make the proceedings seem crucial or comic. What shows up on screen is plain lazy on their part and it's painfully dull to watch.                  
Emanuel,2019,100,"                      While the movie does chronicle the happenings of that tragic day and the days that followed, it ultimately gives hope - hope that our world can be transformed, one act of love at a time, into a place of peace for everyone.                  "
The Ivory Game,2016,77,                      Davidson and Ladkani spend too much time manufacturing intrigue in The Ivory Game. Their lack of focus gives the impression of a lack of confidence. That's going to make it difficult to change anyone's mind.                  
The Mustang,2019,95,                      The Mustang is a unique character-driven film that is headlined by a jaw-dropping performance by Matthias Schoenaerts.                  
No Dress Code Required,2017,100,"                      A love story at heart, ""No Dress Code Required"" shows the power of persistence and activism as well as having a famous friend who can appear in a video on behalf of your protest.                  "
The Flood,2019,69,"                      Liang makes an appealing and relatable protagonist, and her character wastes little time kicking seven shades out of the baddies in smoothly choreographed fights.                  "
ACORN and the Firestorm,2017,75,                      [Acorn and the Firestorm] feel simultaneously like old news and disturbingly relevant in our fake news era.                  
Vox Lux,2018,62,"                      However superbly shot, acted, and well-intentioned its message, Vox Lux remains somewhat puzzling, if admirable for its commitment to unconventionality.                  "
Ingrid Goes West,2017,85,"                      The film might've been a funny cringe comedy if it wasn't so disturbing and true. Unfortunately, Spicer does not adequately investigate his topic, and his titular character is denied personal growth.                   "
The Angel,2018,73,"                      Amazing initial sequence and music. The film centers so much on its main character that sometimes forgets about the story, still extremely captivating. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
I Hate Kids,2019,22,"                      It's an uneven film, but there are some funny turns.                  "
Zoe,2018,32,"                      While Doremus' work centers around connections, it's near impossible for the audience to connect with Zoe.                  "
Thugs of Hindostan,2018,19,"                      Like previous works, which include Tashan and Dhoom 3, Acharya's Thugs of Hindostan is big but hollow.                  "

Three Summers,2017,50,                      Three Summers is purely joyous. It's a film that makes me excited and proud to be Australian. It left me with a feeling of hope and pure warmth.                  
The Summit,2017,58,                      The rhetoric is less compelling and the characters are less interesting.                  
Marathon: The Patriots Day Bombing,2016,90,                      The film surprisingly spends a good deal of time exploring the gradual recovery of people who lost limbs in the attack.                  
Naked,2017,0,                      The film clearly does not care about establishing a realistic world.                  
The Toybox,2018,31,"                      The Toybox remains decidedly and disappointingly tame, despite its wild concept.                  "

A Question of Faith,2017,40,"                      While Otto demonstrates a good deal of passion for his project, it isn't matched by a similar level of creativity.                  "

You Only Live Once,2017,33,"                      You Only Live Once is a funny action comedy that plays with expectations, going along with them at times and not at others, while looking really good with fantastic shots framing the action and the film's nonsense.                  "
Larger Than Life: The Kevyn Aucoin Story,2017,90,"                      Director Tiffany Bartok shapes standard biopic raw materials into a vivacious, authentically touching portrait of a man who, in his mere 40 years on Earth, changed the landscape of beauty, fashion, and celebrity in sneakily profound ways.

Monos,2019,92,"                      Overly vague and distant, though it leaves memorable impressions with a handful of moments.                  "
Acrimony,2018,18,"                      It's engaging the way Tyler takes us through the lives of his characters. And in the end, it's an oddly satisfying feeling to be left wondering, who really is the victim here                  "
Stateless,2020,100,                      Stephenson's film is confronting and even radical as it points to corruption and systemic abuse. It's final title cards are hardly shocking.                  
The Escape,2017,76,"                      Like if Todd Solondz made a Lifetime movie, The Escape can feel overbearingly depressing between its sequences of technical and creative strength.                  "
The Healer,2018,17,"                      Some cursing, drinking in faith-based drama.                  "
Stray,2018,100,"                      If you can meet its pace, and agree to bask in the visuals, the tone, and the performances, the fact that little happens should be of minimal concern.                  "

I See You,2019,79,"                      It could have gone very wrong and, beyond a few conventions and effects, the result is positive. [Full Review in Spanish]                  "
Bobbi Jene,2017,61,                      There's more on the horizon for Bobbi Jene Smith and I hope to see what her future will yield. I guess there's this film to thank for that. Laura Dern's brief appearance is a plus.                  
Mermaids,2017,100,                      Mermaids does a good job humanizing a potentially ludicrous practice...                  
Birthright: A War Story,2017,100,"                      Based on information in the film, it is very much needed.                  "

Rebels on Pointe,2017,100,"                      It's a charming and shrewd take on the male ballerinas of the legendary Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo, part performance documentary and part portrait of the performers and the company.                  "
The Angry Birds Movie 2,2019,73,"                      While the first movie read as an infuriating corporate exercise that doubled as a troubling polemic against anyone different to yourself, the sequel is merely a bit dull.                  "
Different Flowers,2017,80,                      Emma Bell is an absolute gem as Millie.                  
Isabelle,2018,7,"                      ...some of the horror sequences are well done, with some interesting visuals as well, but it is in the handling of grief and mental illness that the movie stumbles.                  "

I Am Another You,2017,95,                      [Nanfu sets] up a far more multifaceted and affecting portrait of privilege and mental illness than the documentary's early quixotic point of view would have you anticipate.                  
Discreet,2017,70,"                      It's hard to like Discreet, with its long-winded earnestness and grave protagonist.                  "
Jackals,2017,44,"                      It's not quite up there with the invasive horror of The Strangers or You're Next, but Jackals still manages to deliver enough genre-specific beats to make it worth a glance for hardcore horror fans.                  "
The Lion King,2019,52,                      There is simply no amount of money Disney can come up with to have the animals emote.                  
Late Night,2019,79,"                      Here is a comedy from Mindy Kaling that has some bite, but a surprising lack of sharp teeth that plays it all too timidly.                  "
Schemers,2019,41,"                      It seems that despite being a biopic and being able to do what he likes, Mclean has missed the point and whereas he could have fleshed out the minor characters, he seems more interested in what he had done himself.                  "
Disobedience,2017,84,"                      I will always stand by the silent, slightly uncomfortable beauty of this particular moment...                  "
Becoming Bond,2017,78,"                      Like any life well-lived there are plenty of detours into humor, drama, success and regret, and hearing it all from a wizened man with an admirable outlook is exactly the type of feel-good material which makes for a fun flick.                  "
The Case for Christ,2017,61,"                      The Case for Christ, although the story of one man's journey to faith, can also inspire life-long believers...                  "
The Basement,2018,20,"                      I do recommend this movie, if anything for Davis displaying his acting chops for all to see.                   "
Spider,2019,90,"                      It splendidly captures a fragment of the political history of Chile, but it doesn't provoke me even the remotest emotion with its hollow characters and its socio-political parable about the nefarious consequences of the far-right.

Kuso,2017,36,"                      This is why the Black director and cast composed of mostly people of colour is so important. It shows that we too have a sensibility for the avant-garde, perhaps even more so since some of our real-life experiences can be surreal...                  "
The First Purge,2018,55,"                      Despite its goofiness and inflated sense of relevance, “The First Purge” is serviceable throwaway entertainment....But it’s still not a movie to recommend.

Solis,2018,0,"                      A space survival film that almost but not quite survives its own ambition; which I can forgive, as it is the writer/director's first feature.                  "

Downrange,2017,72,                      This shootout slasher definitely has its moments... it does its job.                  
Once Upon A Time,2017,40,                      The TV series version surely makes a lot more sense.                  
Aladdin,2019,57,"                      While Smith and Massoud do display some buddy chemistry, it’s Naomi Scott’s fierce performance as Jasmine that’s the real showstopper.                  "
The Peacemaker,2016,87,"                      After 60 minutes, Peacemaker loses traction and shifts into a maudlin, slow-moving, and perverse unraveling of the man and his self-ordained mission.                  "
Bullitt County,2018,50,"                      McCracken's direction is expert, down to some flashy split-screen razzle-dazzle, and the performances... are volatile yet engaging.                  "
The Aeronauts,2019,72,                      [Jones and Redmayne] have enough chemistry to keep things interesting.                  
Ambulance,2016,100,"                      Broad in scope but also deeply personal, Ambulance is a stunning piece of journalism and a harrowing account of the immense (and sometimes irreparable) damage war can inflict on a civilian population.                  "
Skin in the Game,2019,67,                      They show us all these really salacious scenes... With a bunch of bad dialogue.                  
Dark Wind,2017,80,"                      Owing to the clarity of the vision that powers the film, Kadvi Hawa hits home with the force of a gale.                  "
The Humanity Bureau,2017,25,"                      This is the fate of Nicolas Cage, doomed to wander the planet in a seemingly endless cinematic purgatory, and The Humanity Bureau is his latest descent into subgenre mediocrity.                  "
John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum,2019,89,"                      “Parabellum” is an old-school action-lover’s dream, with a body count that easily rivals anything put up by Schwarzenegger or Stallone in the 1980’s. Yet it’s loaded with style and character.                  "
Waiting for the Barbarians,2019,54,"                      It’ll be too broad and figurative for some, but I loved its willingness to trust the viewer. And the near apocalyptic final shot only adds to the title’s richness.                  "

Invisible Life,2019,94,"                      As great as the rest of the film is, it’s that final sequence that lifts it to potential all-timer status, pulling all the story threads together in an unexpected way to reach a crescendo of emotions that only the best melodramas can reach.

Bombshell,2019,68,                      Shines a spotlight on a horrible but important true story but the film never truly manages to reach the same level as the three terrific lead actresses.

Simran,2017,70,"                      Kangana [Ranaut] keeps us watching. With her plain unvarnished face, and mobile features, she comes across as a real, solid, complex woman, someone you can reach out and touch.                  "
Newness,2017,71,"                      The movie can get a bit depressing, but it's still very hot.                  "
Trumped: Inside the Greatest Political Upset of All Time,2017,36,                      A phenomenal and often funny triumph of election coverage repurposed as history lesson.                  
1985,2018,96,"                      In spite of its somber source material, 1985 finds a surprisingly happy note to end on.                  "
The Ballad of Buster Scruggs,2018,89,                      The stories that involve the least efflorescent Coen dialogue — the ones driven by stark silences or old coots talking to their mules — come off the best.                  
Eva,2018,14,"                      Eva hints at a range of intriguing concepts, and plays up its vagaries to allow for a range of interpretations, but ultimately the film isn't as interesting as it thinks.                  "
Fast Color,2018,81,"                      Beautifully conceived both narratively and visually; thematically rich and full of inspiration. This is a film truly worth championing, and I’m happy to do so.                  "
Little Woods,2018,95,                      A slow-burning tale of poverty and limited options that gradually closes-in on the viewer with a claustrophobic sense of tension.                  
Chameleon,2019,100,                      Chameleon's non-linear narrative and slow-paced rythm turns a small crime story into a though-provoking piece that earns some unexpected and well deserved rewatchability value.                  
Proud Mary,2018,25,                      The story is woefully too conventional and predictable.

Intruders,2016,50,"                      One bright spot in the film is Martin Starr's performance as one of the invaders. He is cocky and sarcastic, and though not physically intimidating his malevolent attitude makes me not want to spend any time with him.                  "

Stockholm,2018,70,                      It is a difficult task to produce an original twist on the genre. Which is ironic given this is the story that inspired it all.

Serenity,2019,21,"                      Its weirdness seems to come from a desire not to give juicy pleasure but to provoke deep philosophical thought, and I’m afraid a thriller can commit no greater sin.                  "

May it Last: A Portrait of the Avett Brothers,2017,89,                      Apatow and Bonfiglio do a fine job creating a portrait that should satisfy fans and serve as an inviting introduction to those who don't know the Avett's classic American music.                  
Jellyfish,2018,84,                      This superbly acted coming-of-age Brit flick isn't exactly what you'd call a comedy - but it's a helluva set.                  
The Rainbow Bridge Motel,2018,33,"                      Whilst nothing is likely to offend, this contributes to a sense of clumsiness about the whole endeavour, as if the film were written, cast and shot within a week.                  "

Action Point,2018,16,"                      Action Point is Knoxville's The Shootist, or perhaps his Unforgiven. It's kind of a lukewarm movie, but it's also got moments of beauty and melancholy for what it means for those involved.                  "

Silence,2017,83,                      “Silence” seeks to be something more – a spiritual epic that not only reflects where Scorsese is in his personal journey but challenges us in ours.                  
Sadie,2018,79,                      Schloss and Lynskey deliver heart wrenching performances in this strikingly femme-centric film which shoots an arrow right into the heart of domestic disruption that results from faraway wars.                  
The Colony,2021,52,"                      The stark dismal environments brings thoughts of “Waterworld” and “Mad Max” but without the big studio shine. Instead Fehlbaum’s world is ugly, gritty and palpable.                  "
Lemonade,2018,89,"                      It points out, from a socio-political perspective and with a sober treatment, the grayish sides of the condition of immigrants who seek the American dream. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
Nancy,2018,86,                      The dueling tensions of the film are quite fascinating.                   
Eternity,2017,100,"                      The dialogue is simple and effective, the resonance of the Aymara language almost musical in construction. [Full Review in Spanish]                  "
The Departure,2017,100,"                      This is a film that is clear-eyed about human frailty and sadness, but also deeply in love with the very nature of our existence.                  "
Animals,2017,86,"                      Animals is The Tenant gone wilding - it's the Aussie Animal Attack movie Long Weekend, but taxidermied.                  "
The Beach Bum,2019,57,                      Episode 34: Relaxer / A Scanner Darkly / The Beach Bum / Holy Motors                  
Indivisible,2018,74,"                      Sarah Drew gives a tremendously sensitive, informed performance.                  "
Haseena,2017,0,"                      The drudgery is only aggravated when the director resorts to outmoded, by-the-numbers storytelling that has little to commend itself. In the end, the film achieves neither grit nor glory.                  "
Knock,2017,25,                      ...a passing fever quickly cured and forgotten.                  
Rey,2017,83,"                      Rey is a bold, freakish marvel, a bottle in the ocean of cinema, but worth cracking open-it contains not one message but a whole mass of them, scrawled in many different scripts and colors with artisanal passion and (sometimes) genuine inspiration.                  "
The Kindness of Strangers,2019,31,"                      The glum, disparate stories never gel into a satisfying whole. Scherfig is entitled to a misfire when she's a filmmaker of skill and sensitivity; I'm looking forward to what she does next.                  "
An Evening with Beverly Luff Linn,2018,53,                      ...one of the strangest movies ever made...                  
Open 24 Hours,2018,45,                      A modern slasher about a young woman starting a new life after a term in prison for trying to kill her serial killer boyfriend. Excellent psychological and gory fare from Padraig Reynolds.                  
Last Call,2021,0,"                      It's difficult to muster much sympathy for this collection of drunken slackers, while any quirky charm is wiped away by a reliance on narrative cliches.                  "
The Quake,2018,85,                      ...an often excessively deliberate drama...                  
Zero,2018,27,"                      Thank the cosmos for Bollywood's dimpled wonder, his charisma and enthusiasm undiminished by his 53 years, because without him, Zero has little going for it.                  "
Close Enemies,2018,58,"                      Perfectly fine, and kind of boring.                  "
Pickups,2017,60,"                      Gillen's self-mockery is appealing, the film is smoothly and professionally shot with something of the feeling of a music video, and it playfully flags up some fascinating conundrums about life in its brief...running time.                  "
Haunt,2019,69,"                      Although I've seen plenty of horror movies with similar plotting and more compelling characters, few slashers have disturbed me, and continue to disturb me, as much as Haunt.                  "
Spark,2017,13,"                      Honestly, this movie was absolutely painful. Not because it was frustratingly terrible, but because of how this was such a wasted opportunity.                  "
Stuntman,2018,100,"                      Judging by how seared into Eddie Braun's young imagination Evel Knievel's 1974 attempt to rocket across an Idaho canyon was, this film could leave a similarly lasting impression on viewers today.                  "
Cold War,2018,92,                      Two fine lead performances drive the central relationship which is filled with intense passion but also missed opportunities at every turn.                  
Being Frank,2018,34,                      Jim Gaffigan shows us he can do both comedy and drama in this crazy film about lies begetting lies and the love a child for his father.                  
Reprisal,2018,8,"                      The out-of-time iconography, decades-straddling style, and anywhere USA setting invite the audience to relish Reprisal's pulp ethos and appreciate the twists and turns of the ride as Doris unleashes chaos.                  "
Dog Years,2017,59,                      Rifkin has made a very clever turn for Reynolds- whom he obviously adores- in Dog Years.                  
The Cleaner,2021,83,"                      There's something dirty and rotten about The Cleaner. And it's not just the scumbag characters in this movie. It's a crime drama that tries to go for gritty realism, but it's just a ridiculous mess of a story with terrible dialogue and lousy acting.                  "
Monster Party,2018,77,"                      Monster Party is a fun, gloriously gory romp into the fetishes and entitlement of the upper crust.                  "
The Apparition,2018,73,"                      The film is deeply engaging, carefully and methodically executed, and wholly satisfying as a portrait of two lost souls who find some type of inner comfort in the other.                  "
X-Men: Dark Phoenix,2019,22,"                      This time they do justice to the story, not without a few kinks, but still in a way I found entertaining and satisfying.                  "
The Gardener,2016,75,"                      Audiences may leave feeling they'll never approach Cabot's level of expertise, but they may conclude they have enough time to throw together a little vegetable garden after all.                  "
Native Son,2019,60,"                      At times quite visually stunning, but with tonal incongruities that make for a disjointed viewing experience.                  "
Most Likely to Murder,2018,62,                      You can't help but wish it would have been a little bit funnier considering the past work of both of the writers.                  
Gags the Clown,2018,38,"                      A watchable, but unengaging film that passes the time without being fully satisfying.                  "
Human Flow,2017,91,"                      [The refugees'] situation is extreme, the risks dire, and they're real people. Was it obscene to parade them for my consumption, or was my irritation at his constantly inserting himself into the frame like Hitchcock beside the point?                  "
Phoenix Forgotten,2017,45,                      Enjoyment of Phoenix Forgotten ultimately depends on how much the individual viewer likes found footage movies.                  
The Silent Revolution,2018,90,"                      What is the source of the romanticization and nostalgia? ...It is a longing that is especially evident in mainstream films like ""The Silent Revolution,"" for simpler days, when it was possible to distinguish between the good guys and the bad guys.                  "
The Last Animals,2017,100,"                      This isn't rosy viewing. But believing that, as residents of the planet, we should take serious note of the extinction crisis, Brooks lays out the facts and makes clear the urgency. This film deserves attention.                  "
El Mar La Mar,2017,100,                      Isolationism won't solve the problem in the capitalist society where economic inequality is the root cause of all problems. El mar la mar addresses human cost of the border politics in a way that only the film medium can.                  
Pause,2018,100,"                      Pause is not an easy or a pleasant film to watch, but it does have individual moments and sequences that are simply transfixing, as well as a strong, well-defined painterly aesthetic.                  "
Drive,2019,0,                      A rough and rash thriller that has the power to drive even the most undemanding Bollywood fan up the wall.                  
Pond Life,2018,73,"                      Adapted from a stage play, this British coming-of-age drama follows in the footsteps of the likes of Ken Loach and Mike Leigh in its depiction of ""ordinary"" people going about ""ordinary"" lives.                  "
The Innocent,2018,33,                      The Innocent is a masterfully directed character study in moral gravity.                  
Los Perros,2017,69,                      Intense. [Full Review in Spanish]                  
Invisible,2017,75,"                      ""Giorgelli does not judge his central character, but shows her in full action: empathy can come from know her""                  "
The Ranger,2018,76,"                      Pays its respects to the storied history of iconic slashers, only to serve more as a disappointing homage to the '80s without offering anything new.                  "
Take Me,2017,70,                      Take Me is a solid directorial debut from Pat Healy and will hopefully be a sign of good things to come as he transitions to a career behind the camera.                  
A Suitable Girl,2017,88,"                      A documentary that is simultaneously inquisitive, critical of, and loving toward the complexities of societal expectations alongside an evolving world, and will genuinely open your eyes to the layers of a tradition that aren't typically peeled back.                  "
Stalker,2019,92,"                       Prime level acting, this quiet fear that ""grabs you and gets into you"", and at the end it won't disappoints. [Full review in Spanish].                  "
Clara,2018,54,"                      Clara is a small but perfectly played movie that deserves to be singled out for praise, for an intelligent storyline, for a genuine interest in science, and a romance that gives the film heart...                  "
Icon,2016,62,"                      The Program feels uneven, as though it couldn't decide whether to be a dramatically reenacted exposé of Armstrong's lies or a standard drama.                  "
Listen,2020,70,"                      For many it will not be an easy thing to watch, especially for those with children, but it may help some to understand and empathise with immigrants who just want a good life.                  "
Bad Times at the El Royale,2018,74,"                      Goddard deftly maneuvers his unconventional narrative while playing with time, tinkering with points of view, and tossing in a MacGuffin or two.                  "
Copwatch,2017,60,                      Well...Here we are gain in 2020 talking about police brutality and injustice once again. What's different? The revolution and injustice is filmed and black folks are not going down without the scales of justice being tipped forever.                  
Jinn,2018,91,"                      It's not necessarily a bad film, but it does fall into the trap where its impact could have been magnified to greater heights, absently leaving some of its ambitious storytelling as a wasted opportunity.                  "
Triple Threat,2019,67,                      Episode 33: Triple Threat / The Raid / Dragged Across Concrete                  
A Quiet Place,2018,96,"                      It’s smart, light on gore, but heavy on tension. It knows its premise and fully embraces it. Never does it feel the need to give us tedious and uninteresting exposition nor does it overstay its welcome.                  "
Darkness Falls,2020,13,"                      At nearly every chance, “Darkness Falls” makes the least interesting and most unfortunate choice, resulting in a film that’s uninteresting and certainly a choice.                  "
Youth,2017,81,"                      As a drama, Youth is full of nostalgia and sentimentality - however, there is not enough here to truly engage the audience into the lives of the troupe.                  "
Every Time I Die,2019,100,"                      A character-driven supernatural thriller that keeps viewers puzzling out what's happening along with its main character, Every Time I Die introduces a director and actors to watch out for.                  "
What They Had,2018,87,                      Chomko pulls from her personal experience of having a grandmother diagnosed with dementia and being part of the family struggling to deal with it.                   
The Spy Who Dumped Me,2018,49,"                      Not dark enough to be a dark comedy, not funny enough to be a full on comedy, not romantic enough to be a rom com and certainly not thrilling enough to give 007 a run for this money.                  "
The Marriage,2017,75,                      One of the more impressive European feature debuts of the year.                  
Dolittle,2020,15,"                      It's not hilarious but it is cheerful, good to look at, and has surely at least managed a pass.                  "
Transit,2018,95,"                      The world Petzold defines is girded by fear, paranoia, and uncertainty yet his direction and the performances show a confident restraint.                  "
In a Relationship,2018,60,"                      Most often, the aspirations of the characters are made to be fun, quirky, and endearing instead of something to criticize and laugh at. The result is a voyeuristic peek inside of their vapid lives.                  "
Outlaw King,2018,62,                      ...watchable yet undeniably hit-and-miss...                  
CarGo,2017,60,"                      There's no pleasure in saying this was a disappointment. Something powerful was expected right out the gate, but Kareem Mortimer's film leans away from making such statements as if it's too hard to tackle the nuances it sets up.                  "
Miracle,2017,40,"                      Miracle's dry sense of humor, strong female lead, and intriguing complexities warrant doing your homework.                  "
Acts of Violence,2018,0,                      What could've been a decent cheap thrill is really nothing more than a somewhat unhealthy way to kill 85 minutes.                  
After Everything,2018,84,"                      After Everything is a remarkably honest, bittersweet, and fresh romance. It honestly depicts a relationship that’s at times both unique and all too familiar.                  "
Extraordinary Mission,2017,80,                      Yet all Extraordinary Mission does is reveal how stylistically indistinct much Chinese action cinema has become from its Western counterparts.                  
Stray Dolls,2019,71,                      The last 15 minutes of the movie have so many absurd things happening ... that Stray Dolls should have been named Stray Plot Holes.                  
Ittefaq,2017,90,"                      It is a thriller that remains watchable without being a consistently pulsating, heart-pounding experience.                  "
AlphaGo,2017,100,                      The sense of history being made is palpable.                  
Baja,2018,43,"                      Baja doesn't have the most original plot nor an overarching style. But the characters are really likable, the actors' chemistry is off the charts, and the cordial ambiance invites the viewer to lay back and have a good time.                  "
Cheaper by the Dozen,2022,35,"                      This iteration of Cheaper by the Dozen is well-intentioned in that it wants to tell a diverse, inclusive story (mostly, ahem), but in trying to be so broadly representative, there’s no time to tell the myriad stories it wants to tell.                  "
Diane,2018,93,"                      Mary Kay Place never goes for the jugular with any of the material, knowing full well how to make us lean in and feel something just by virtue of her beautiful stillness.                  "
The Tribe,2018,71,"                      It's simple entertainment that will not go to the annals of history, but that does a good job within its purpose. [Full Review in Spanish]                  "
The Reagan Show,2017,80,                      The Reagan Show highlights how the president used the relatively new technology to his advantage. But this documentary isn't merely a walk down memory lane.                  
The Intruder,2019,34,                      Nothing will catch you off guard. Nothing will feel new or fresh. Yet it still manages to be reasonably fun in large part due to Quaid and a role he really sinks his teeth into.                  
Come As You Are,2019,95,"                      Based on the 2011 Belgian film, 'Hasta La Vista,' this movie about three young handicapped men on a clandestine road trip looking for love is funny, heartwarming and emotive.                  "
The Awakening,2013,63,"                      For all its pedestrian qualities, there are a couple of big plus points in its favour. They are Rebecca Hall and Dominic West.                   "
Tyrel,2018,60,                      Even though Jason Mitchell is quite strong... [Tyrel] goes in no direction at all.                  
Revenge,2017,93,"                      Revenge is a promising first film and, with any luck, perhaps Fargeat will approach her next film with more of an eye on instilling some dimensionality into her characters to achieve a stronger sense of catharsis.                  "
I Am Heath Ledger,2017,86,"                      With emotions just as raw, this is a story that fans needed. It celebrates an artist whose star power will always burn bright, and whose artistic nature set him apart.                  "
Find Me,2018,100,"                      This film could have easily devolved into some corny Nicholas Sparks drivel or low-brow comedy bro-fest, but instead, Huang tells it perfectly, never getting too sappy or letting the humor get in the way of the story.                  "
Number One,2017,100,"                      Starring the luminous Emmanuelle Devos as the first potential CEO of a CAC 40 company, the glass ceiling of the usual old boys' club finds itself groaning under the pressure of a woman finally awakening to the full magnitude of her potential.                  "
The Guilty,2018,98,                      The Danish film “The Guilty” is the latest glowing example of how great writing and a good actor’s steely intensity is more than enough for a genuinely gripping thriller.                  
Lost Transmissions,2019,54,"                      The kind of gritty, naturalistic type of film that seldom gets made anymore.                  "
Room for Rent,2019,83,                      A light-hearted dark comedy about the consequences of frittering away a fortune.                  
Plan B,2018,96,"                      Plan B offers the counterpoint that this genre of film can live on, but that it maybe just needs some new perspectives through which these stories are being told.                   "
Parasite,2019,99,"                      Incredible storytelling and examination of the class structure in Korea... Strong characterisation and performances create empathy from audiences, themselves becoming parasites to the film as host. Clinging on for dear life until the thrilling conclusion.                  "
Bombshell: The Hedy Lamarr Story,2017,95,                      Episode 14: Doc Talk                  
Chained for Life,2018,100,"                      It's less like a dream than it is a trippy sniff off the fumes of a failed suicide by carbon-monoxide poisoning - that's a compliment, by the way!                  "
King Lear,2018,91,                      Yet the film is such a cracking good entertainment I barely even noticed that its world makes no sense.                  
Freedom Fields,2018,91,"                      A tough and tumultuous tale that doesn't shy away from its complex issues, but it has such an inspiring core that it's impossible not to get behind these amazing women.                  "
The Captain,2017,83,"                      Director Robert Schwentke shoots in black and white, yet the story is strictly black, giving little insight into the cruel, impressively coolheaded Herold (Max Hubacher) except that he's incensed at the German retreat.                  "
Foxtrot,2017,94,                      Its way of condemning the absurdity of war in three episodes captivates me when I least expect it. [Full review in Spanish]                  
Dogman,2018,84,                      [Director Matteo] Garrone shows us how far the human soul can go after having suffered acts of psychological violence. [Full review in Spanish]                  
American Dreamer,2018,53,"                      It's a far cry from Gaffigan's typical optimism, and not anywhere near as funny. But as is often the case in comedy, American Dreamer works because it feels true, and bleakly, unapologetically possible.                  "
Escape Plan: The Extractors,2019,25,                      Largely a waste of time and talent                  
Truth or Dare,2018,15,                      The big problem of the film is its lack of corrosive mood or the slightest destabilizing element. [Full Review in Spanish]                  
Occupation,2018,48,"                      After an intriguing set up, Occupation quickly leans on cliched character types and storylines that an original setting still can't make interesting.                  "
No Stone Unturned,2017,80,                      The strength of the documentary comes from its ability to tell the victims stories so clearly and profoundly.                  
Night School,2018,27,"                      Haddish, though, matches Hart’s up-tempo comic energy, which also has some genuinely funny supporting turns.                  "
The Little Match Girl,2017,100,"                      The script is full of pleasurable little twists and turns, handled with an agility and freshness that prevent proceedings from ever feeling contrived.                  "
I Feel Pretty,2018,35,                      “I Feel Pretty” is a movie with a message – a genuinely good message. And we are constantly getting whiffs of it throughout. Unfortunately it’s buried in a tonally challenged film with an glaring identity crisis.                  
Champions,2018,75,"                      'Champions' is not a movie that will change your life, but it does have the right keys to be entertaining. [Full Review in Spanish]                  "
I Am Evidence,2017,100,"                      Despite every effort to silence these women, some have nevertheless made themselves heard as crusaders for change. Their strength is the reason I Am Evidence is a heartbreaking experience rather than a completely devastating one.                  "
Frank Serpico,2017,75,"                      He's a fascinating character, whether played by Pacino in Lumet's film or just being himself in D'Ambrosio's.                  "
A Gray State,2017,100,                      A fascinating case of whodunnit and paranoia related to a mysterious filmmaker whose work raises questions. [Full review in Spanish].                  
Hell on Earth: The Fall of Syria and the Rise of ISIS,2017,100,"                      Hell on Earth is not an easy watch - it's infuriating and harrowing, and the footage is raw and visceral - but it should be compulsory viewing.                  "
The Public Image is Rotten,2017,63,                      [The Public Image is Rotten] makes one wonder: Does anyone still care?                  
A Ciambra,2017,89,                      The Ciambra is a powerful coming-of-age story that ventures where rarely any other films dare to go.                  
The Ledge,2022,35,"                      This thriller should have you on the ledge of your seat, however the end result is not really worth the climb.                  "
Playtime,2013,98,"                      Staying with the movie can be a bit of a challenge, and the humor is spread out and more subtle. But the craftsmanship behind this film can’t be questioned, and the sheer scope of the undertaking is incredible.                   "
Escapes,2017,90,"                      To make it in Hollywood, you got to have duende, and Hampton Fancher has duende in spades.                  "
About Endlessness,2019,94,"                      Andersson isn't saying there is balance, he's saying there are small moments of kindness and joy to cherish.                  "
Jumbo,2020,76,                      The film may strive for a message of tolerance and acceptance but it is let down by rushed and unsatisfying conclusion... like a theme park ride that has a fantastic build up but then the actual ride is over too quickly and ultimately a disappointment.                  
The Right One,2021,40,"                      Clumsy romance addresses mental health; swearing, sex.                  "
Arctic,2018,90,                      It’s hard to think of anyone better equipped to lead this movie than Mads Mikkelsen. His tough exterior and rugged disposition is only outdone by his innate ability to speak volumes with so few words.                  
Glass,2019,36,"                      “Glass” actually worked for me and I’m anxious to see it again. But it took some time to get there, and I still find myself mulling over the final act.                  "
Parmanu: The Story of Pokhran,2018,33,"                      When the blasts send tremors through the desert, all you feel is your eardrums suffering from high-decibel distress.                  "
The Giant,2019,53,"                      Exploring memory, grief, and the trauma of growing up, the film turns the fear of adulthood into a monster that lurks in the storm clouds gathering on the horizon.                  "
Mr. Jones,2019,86,                      “Mr. Jones” feels like a neglected slice of history that’s finally being exposed.                   
Blowin' Up,2018,94,                      I think it's rather shapeless... You don't really find out what these sessions accomplish.                  
Welcome Home,2018,10,"                      This is a thriller that starts off with some promise, but soon lapses into predictability.                  "
Atomic Homefront,2017,100,"                      This film won't be easy to watch, but I strongly recommend you do it. And maybe check the maps and be very aware of whether there are untreated Superfund sites near where you live.                  "
Legacy of Lies,2020,86,"                      Despite the script's investment in character development, the power dynamic in any given scene always boils down to who has the biggest Uzi.                  "
Summerland,2020,78,                      Summerland offers a refreshingly modern take on a genre that usually is as diverse as various colors of freshly fallen snow — though it ignores riskier choices that were there for the taking.                  
Wild Mountain Thyme,2020,26,                      Wild Mountian Thyme is a cinematic oddity. A film completely devoid of (lucky) charms but simultaneously a must-see movie. Cult classic status awaits!                  
Man Camp,2019,100,                      The strength of Man Camp is this story of a family moving on from grief.                  
Yomeddine,2018,77,"                      ""Yomeddine"" shows an Egypt rarely seen on the big screen. The villages scattered from north to south are devoid of the hustle and bustle of the capital - a dystopia-like wasteland forgotten and abandoned by the ruling elite.                  "
Far From the Tree,2017,90,"                      It's a beautiful, meaningful film that powerfully illustrates what it's like to be different for those who are different and their families.                  "
Peppermint,2018,13,                      I really like the weightiness that [Jennifer Garner] brought to the material.                  
Violet,2021,82,                      Screenwriting legend Robert McKee said “characters must change… and the change must come from within”. Violet is a rather literal interpretation of this rule but is ultimately an empowering tale of believing in oneself.                  
Hammer,2019,80,"                      It asks, and mostly answers, big questions about unconditional love and how far a father will go to help his son. Why this wasn't released on Father's Day I'll never know.                  "
The Longest Night,2019,83,"                      Since Chronicles (Sebastián Cordero, 2004), ecuadorian cinema has not being this prolific. [Full review in spanish].                  "
Us,2019,93,"                      With “Us” the aim may be a little messy, but Peele brings it together with sharp instincts and a better grasp of scene-to-scene storytelling and tension-building.                  "
Book Club,2018,54,                      Book Club made me want to give up reading altogether.                  
In Your Hands,2018,38,"                      A tone-deaf pastiche, at best.                  "
Support the Girls,2018,91,"                      The opening credits lets you know that the film is operating on a shoestring budget, but within five minutes I was already invested in this slice-of-life working class comedy.                  "
The Little Stranger,2018,65,                      Abrahamson captures the viewer in a chilling and perplexing narrative that nonetheless feels satisfying in its many ambiguities.                  
Shadow,2018,94,"                      Palace intrigue and ornate martial arts duels are just the surface of Shadow, Zhang Yimou's stunning 2018 period epic of doppelgangers, zither duets, double-crosses, and monochrome colors splattered with blood.                  "
Becoming Who I Was,2017,100,"                      A good documentary doesn't need to tell you everything, but it should arouse your curiosity about the world around you. This one certainly does.                  "
Adventures of a Mathematician,2020,50,                      The parts don't quite add up in this uneven period drama that squanders some intriguing true-life source material.                  
Carmen,2022,100,"                      I choose to overlook its obvious flaws, as I was enjoying how the church was getting pay back for its past indulgences.                  "
Hurt,2018,71,"                      Hurt is a well-crafted experimental horror film that plays with multiple key aspects of slashers while pouring a fresh, unconventional take on the genre.                   "
A Taxi Driver,2017,96,"                      Despite overlong and emotionally elaborate, Hun Jang's drama film has its moments and ensures amusement.                  "
The Devil and Father Amorth,2017,44,"                      With the whole film shot on a static, handheld video camera, both the content and execution fail to keep the attention, and at only 68 minutes long, Father Amorth still manages to drag incessantly.                  "
A Kid Like Jake,2018,50,"                      Claire Danes is a revelation, playing a character that flips the script on gender-based parenting norms. Her character is abrasive, annoying, even abusive, as she deals with the anxiety of not knowing how to raise her child.                  "
Money,2019,67,                      Money successfully depicts the drug-like high of chasing fool's gold and has the ability to lure the audience into its narcotic haze.                  
The World Is Yours,2018,95,"                      A “one last job/score” tale that takes its title from the DePalma/Pacino “Scarface” and its style from “Snatch” era Guy Ritchie. Yeah, it’s funny. And violent. And very French.                  "
Itsy Bitsy,2019,60,"                      Throughout the whole film everything is so overly spelled out and we're constantly being reminded about it. They left no room for the audience to have an ""aha moment"".                  "
The Marksman,2021,39,                      Is nothing but trope-filled inconsequential scenes that follow the hollow action thriller playbook genre step by each yawn-inducing step.                  
High Voltage,2018,33,"                      Sold on the fact that David Arquette and Luke Wilson star, the latter is in three scenes and makes little to no impact to the story or film.                  "
XY Chelsea,2019,65,                      [There are] many twists and turns to [Chelsea] Manning's saga that this revealing documentary chronicles with an unwavering purpose: to show viewers who she really is and how she has adjusted to life outside of prison.                  
Mirage,2018,75,"                      Barely surviving its absurd length, this movie feels like a ton of genres mixed into a clever idea that suffers but works. [Full review in Spanish].                  "
Bergman Island,2021,84,"                      Once you get past the initial joy of geeking out on Bergman, you can fully appreciate the ways in which Hansen-Løve has channeled the artistic inspiration she gets from the filmmaker into her own work here.                  "
Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again,2018,79,"                      It's silly and at times even ridiculous, but it's delivered in such a genuine manner that you welcome and embrace the silliness of it all.                  "
Resistance,2020,56,"                      Jesse Eisenberg is very good in Resistance, but ultimately the film is a reminder that a Mime is a terrible thing to waste.                  "
Buffalo Boys,2018,79,"                      Buffalo Boys is never as epic or sweeping as it hopes to be, nor as ruthless or brutal, but it's an entertaining, imminently watchable, if ultimately forgettable action western.                  "
Johnny English Strikes Again,2018,37,                      It is perhaps time for Johnny English to have his license to kill revoked.                  
The Wait,2016,73,                      “L’attesa” is a challenge. It requires patience and a willingness to look beyond a mere surface impression.                  
Manto,2018,74,"                      Nandita Das makes her Manto a stirring, sensitive portrait of a tortured genius from an era seemingly long past yet tragically mirroring our troubled present.                  "
Midway,2019,42,                      The Battle of Midway is one of the most amazing stories in military history and I was very pleased to see a new film featuring that story.  MIDWAY (2019) is the rare war film that gets more points for historic accuracy than for entertainment.                  
Daddy,2017,50,"                      I ended up drinking in every single frame, and searching for a full film.                  "
All Square,2018,91,"                      By the time John's inevitable redemptive arc comes around, it feels like we've witnessed All Square many times before.                  "
Hunt,2022,68,"                      Hunt is an ugly morality play, briskly told and given chilling, crackling energy by Lee and Jung.                  "
Prodigy,2018,74,                      “Prodigy” still manages to be a thoughtful and suspenseful thriller and does so despite its small scale and even smaller budget. I mean practically the entire film takes place in two rooms.                  
Puzzle,2018,83,"                      This performance, arguably the best in Macdonald's career, is masterful and elevates the modest pleasures of the film.                  "
Eye for an Eye,2019,89,                      A Shakespearean-quality drama of revenge and family conflict from a quality Spanish pedigree.                  
The Dread,2017,80,                      A great visit into a dark corner of superstition. It's curious at first. But it gets very disturbing once details are shown. [Full review in Spanish].                  
Samson,2018,25,"                      Aimed squarely at Christian audiences looking for inspirational family entertainment, Samson is a preachy and plodding drama that's light on excitement, action or any real sense of spirituality.                  "
The Kindergarten Teacher,2018,90,"                      Glimpses of an inner universe about to implode in slow motion (...) living through the creative world of another, with ferocious intensity of reclaiming one's own.                  "
Nureyev,2018,85,                      It is stylistically beautiful... This really gets to the heart of [Nureyev].                  
Little Italy,2018,13,"                      Little Italy is so stereotypical of cultures and sexual orientations, goes so out of its way to be different for the sake of being different, and oddly plays things safe when you think the script will try something new. It’s just bizarre.                  "
Duck Butter,2018,55,                      Duck Butter only succeeds in making its characters feel uncomfortably trapped in a pact of their own making.                  
Sweet Country,2017,96,"                      The movie is a sincere work, with some remarkable performances, that centrally features Australia's parched, barren desert landscape.                  "
Green Book,2018,77,                      The biggest strength lies in the chemistry between Mortensen and Ali. Without it the entire movie would fall apart.                   
The Perfect Candidate,2019,93,                      [Haifaa Al-Mansour] delivers a razor-sharp look at women's lives in modern Saudi Arabia.                  
Blackmail,2018,56,"                      Blackmail isn't exactly a zippy thriller that rattles along at an even pace, but owing to the quality of the pivotal performance from Irrfan, luminous as ever, it is persistently riveting.                  "
Good Boys,2019,80,                      The super sweet yet seriously sour antics of the Good Boys makes for one seriously gut-busting good time.                  
Tollbooth,2021,86,                      as darkly comic as the Coen Brothers and violent as a Tarantino flick... The sharp and witty script allows [Smiley] to use his natural charm and humour whilst tapping into a steeliness under the surface.                  
Empowered,2018,71,"                      Without any cheap psychologisms, [director Santiago] Segura's film has its good moments, most of them with [Maribel Verdú]... [Full review in Spanish]                  "
To Let,2019,100,                      Chezhian Ra's To Let is one of the only Indian films of 2019 that I found to be a genuinely moving experience.                  
Wallflower,2019,50,"                      What's so disturbing about Wallflower isn't the subject matter, but that few likely remember this incident because mass shootings are now so commonplace in our country.                  "
Destination Wedding,2018,51,                      Destination Wedding is the first rom-com that had me rooting for the stars’ continued celibacy and hoping they won’t procreate.                  
Ellipsis,2017,86,"                      The big failing of this flaccid film is that the flimsy premise is given no life. The banter between the couple is stilted and forced. There's no modulation or cadence, no sense of a developing relationship.                  "
The Souvenir: Part II,2021,90,"                      As a sequel, it has an aesthetic that projects a certain elegance, but its dramatic side lacks pushfulness and is quite lukewarm when it illustrates the guilt, mourning and self-discovery of a filmmaker.

Boy Erased,2018,81,"                      A deft touch is brought to a delicate subject matter that downplays rather than heightens, even as harrowing as scenes can be.                   "
Lowlife,2017,91,"                      Lowlife is there to remind Hollywood that there are plenty good, entertaining films left to be made before more remakes should be pumped out. It's an original story with a familiar style that works great.                  "

Synonyms,2019,87,"                      I was fine for a stretch, less so as Synonyms kept working itself into a lather around a character whose behavior increasingly comes off not as symbolic of a certain rage but merely annoying...                  "
Every Day,2018,63,                      it's refreshing to see a movie about an issue as narratively complex as this that doesn't get itself tied in knots about it.                  
Kedarnath,2018,47,"                      Fortunately for Kapoor, the performances manage to keep things afloat, taking the emotions to a crescendo matching nature's wrath.                  "
The Swordsman,2020,85,"                      [The Swordsman is] rendered almost wholly ineffective by weak, unintuitive direction and an edit that doesn't know how to show the profound abilities of the film's performers.                  "

Velvet Buzzsaw,2019,61,"                      Jake Gyllenhaal's preening, presumptive, preposterous art critic is a joy to behold... Velvet Buzzsaw is a late night horror. A piece of Grand Guignol trash. Pure and simple. And what glorious trash it is.                  "
The Cleaning Lady,2018,62,"                      This is a horror film... As such, the audience are always waiting in anticipation for the moment where it truly embraces the genre... sadly ends too abruptly to be truly satisfying.                  "
Swing Kids,2018,63,                      The history of this camp is actually true... I just wish somebody made a better movie about it.

The Houses October Built 2,2017,13,"                      Let's call The Houses October Built 2 what it is. It's a vacation reel, released as a found footage horror film under the barest of pretenses to trick people out of their money.                  "
The Front Runner,2018,58,"                      Why has a film that is so focused on driving home the failings of the media come during the current administration’s effort to silence it? Entertaining, uneven, and questionable.                  "
The Day Shall Come,2019,64,"                      It's a biting, uncomfortable satire, but we expect nothing less from the hugely influential Chris Morris.                  "
Breakthrough,2019,62,"                      The script is sexist and bordering on misogynistic. Sadly, this film brought out my inner feminist.                  "

A Whale of a Tale,2017,88,"                      Both sides get ample time to state their case here, resulting in a reconsideration of a controversial issue that, like most such, turns out to be less morally black-and-white the closer you look...                  "

The Unicorn,2018,91,"                      The Unicorn is uncensored and hilariously unpredictable, but it also has meaning. It engages in the concept of stepping outside your comfort zone to take on new experiences - a lovely and enlightening message to take to heart.                  "
The Silencing,2020,17,"                      The Silencing is an underseen, underrated film that knows why its tropes work and stick to its guns.                  "

Unsane,2018,80,"                      Soderberg's manipulation of his audience is masterful, and his formal choices have a throwback appeal, curiously enough, leaving Unsane to feel like a late-night VHS screening of a cheap but memorable horror show.                  "
Jealous,2017,89,"                      Jealous works from a character that does not try to fall well, or believe that comedy needs it to get the laughs. [Full Review in Spanish]                  "

The Fortress,2017,63,"                      The Fortress, for all of its military trappings, is not an action movie. Viewers seeking a political drama mixed with a history lesson will find this much more to their taste.                  "
Batman: Gotham by Gaslight,2018,75,"                      Untethered to Batman's established continuity, it allows the filmmakers to explore different facets of the familiar hero and rearrange the players around him in interesting ways.                  "

Night Comes On,2018,98,"                      Jordana Spiro and first-time screenwriter Angelica Nwandu create a quietly effective drama with a fierce performance from Dominique Fishback. Essentially a revenge Western, her quiet intensity at the end of the film is stunning.                  "

Drift,2017,80,"                      Crucial to Drift's evocation of place is Nika Breithaupt's remarkable sound design, which signals movement and spatial boundaries as much as do the film's visuals.                  "
As I Am,2019,50,                      As the movie slowly trudges to its predictable ending. Pity because it is a well-shot and well-acted movie otherwise.

The Final Year,2017,84,                      I marveled at how director Greg Barker sliced and diced a tumultuous period.                  
Razzia,2017,44,"                      It is eye-opening in its rawness and introduces interesting questions. It leaves many of them unresolved, however, consequently feeling unsure of its message.                  "

Ever After,2018,80,"                      [The] motif is underdeveloped and unconvincing, despite the fact that the film spends a good chunk of its running time dealing with it.                  "
The Velvet Underground,2021,98,"                      Haynes' use of the documentary medium is as remarkable as one might expect from the acclaimed director.

Blindspotting,2018,94,"                      Carlos Estrada’s film, if not the best of the year, is the most important. Blindspotting is shocking, powerful, provocative, incendiary, even funny. It’s ripped from the moment. It encapsulates today’s modern indignation. It’s a contemporary classic.                  "
Artik,2019,100,                      An unusual film about the darkness which resides within truly lost people and the power of salvation.

Welcome to New York,2018,14,"                      Truth be told, parts of the film are fun. If only all of it was equally so, this piece of unpretentious whimsy might have been a far breezier ride. But it is a big, imposing IF that stares us in the face.                  "
Flatland,2019,91,                      Flatland is a satisfyingly genre twisted story that we don't get to see too often.

Joker,2019,68,"                      In the simply titled Joker, we get yet another version and this one is probably the most toxic of them all and not in a satisfying way.                  "

Samson,2017,25,"                      Aimed squarely at Christian audiences looking for inspirational family entertainment, Samson is a preachy and plodding drama that's light on excitement, action or any real sense of spirituality.                  "

Between Worlds,2018,32,                      Between Worlds may not have the surrealness or the haunting cinematography of Mandy. It's the kind of rare cinematic alchemy that no amount of planning and budget can create but happens once when all the planets align for one lucky director.                  
The Wedding,2018,40,"                      This could've, more should've, been a darling of a film in a climate willingly to welcome it with open arms. But, this dreamlike love story plays out more like a forgettable daydream.                  "
Transmilitary,2018,100,                      TransMilitary is a powerful reminder of the resilience and perseverance of the US transgender troops... and of the transgender community at large. It also reminds us that the fight for equity and equality is an on-going battle.                  
Supervized,2019,44,                      Supervized is a sophomoric comedy which never takes advantage of its own originality.                  
Roads,2019,67,"                      By playing it by the book and ticking the right topical boxes in a conventionally structured story, Schipper misses the mark completely.                  "
The Departure,2020,57,"                      It's well-acted but not particularly recommended as a Valentine's Day date flick. For the rest of the year, an optional purchase.                  "
Truth to Power,2020,85,"                      Sure he's a little older, a little plumper and a lot greyer, but the star of An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth To Power is as magnetic as ever and the film revolves around him.                  "

The Silence,2019,29,"                      The Silence is a painful attempt to remake A Quiet Place, which came out the year before.

Maine,2018,55,"                      Unfortunately, the film doesn't give enough for the viewer to feel a connection, so there is no investment on our part, just mere detachment and a ""Oh, she's back where she started,"" before the embracing of a blank screen.                  "
Egg,2018,100,"                      The highlights of Egg come when that odd, uncomfortable formality fades away and Karen and Tina speak openly to each other as only old friends can, for better or worse.                  "
Angelo,2018,80,"                      ""Directed with cold formalist distance by Schleinzer, Angelo is the obvious denunciation of the appropriation / exploitation of the Other"".                  "

47 Meters Down: Uncaged,2019,45,                      This is a fun movie in which fairly ropey CGI sharks tear chunks out of characters who repeatedly make terrible decisions in service of the narrative.                  
The Bill Murray Stories: Life Lessons Learned from a Mythical Man,2018,95,"                      As much as it lacks a defining and definitive moment, it quickly dawns on you how the documentary becomes less about Bill Murray 'the comedic star' but Bill Murray, 'the soul-searching man' seeking higher fulfilment.                  "
Cuban Food Stories,2018,60,"                      Don't pay attention to the ""rottens"". This a glorious film that is in the spirit of Anthony Bourdain but much more centered on the lived experience of ordinary Cubans. A true delight.                  "
Goldie,2019,95,"                      It's a chase movie with a twist: Instead of trying to escape from the police or criminals (which is the usual story in 'urban' movies), the protagonist is trying to keep her family together by trying to escape from Child Protective Services.                  "
Enter the Fat Dragon,2020,64,"                      While I wouldn’t call “Enter the Fat Dragon” a good movie, Donnie Yen at least makes it entertaining.                  "
Behind You,2020,6,                      There is nothing wrong with this film visually or atmospherically but the story left a lot to be desired.

The (Silent) War,2019,60,"                      While several story beats make no sense whatsoever (I didn’t even mention the goofy coyote synergy stuff), “The (Silent) War” still has enough verve and genre appeal to make for an entertaining two hours.                  "
The Art of Self-Defense,2019,83,"                      The Art of Self-Defense is one of the very best dark comedies of the decade, if not the most relevant.                    "
Unbroken: Path to Redemption,2018,38,                      It has some pacing problems... but I still thought it was pretty moving.                  
The Lodge,2019,74,                      One of the most effective chillers of the year. It presents images that will lodge themselves in your mind long after you leave the cinema.                   
The Guardians,2018,94,"                      A stirring World War I era story bathed in humanity and told through great performances, emotive faces and quiet communication.                  "

Raid,2018,67,                      It is set apart from the norms of the genre just a tad because the man leading the crusade against the bad guy isn't a beefed-up action hero in uniform.                  
Dog Days,2018,62,"                      The film celebrates respect, forgiveness, responsibility and generosity.                  "

The Escape of Prisoner 614,2018,20,"                      More of an absurdist comedy than an uproarious one, this mostly works because McDorman and Starr play things completely seriously.                  "
Followers,2021,83,"                      ... It’s fair to say without his [writer/director Marcus Herben] unique voice, it could have been just another found footage-type film. Fortunately, there’s enough wit amongst the scares to make it work.                  "

Black and Blue,2019,51,"                      After a promising start, with a strong Harris in the lead, Black and Blue gives way to a generic against time thriller.                  "
Quiet Heroes,2018,83,"                      This heartfelt documentary is a testament to their life-changing work with the LGBTQ community, who owe a profound debt to Dr. Ries and Maggie Snyder.                  "
Shooter,2012,48,"                      Comparisons to Sylvester Stallone's similarly ill-treated combat vet are paper-thin, since this film is anything but a Rambore.                  "
Primal,2019,38,"                      I love kitchen sink action movies like this where there’s a little bit of everything causing problems. There’s fighting, gore, guns, isolation and wild animals. It’s like Jumanji but with less family-friendly content and more grunting                  "
Initiation,2020,59,                      It may pledge to be “Gen Z’s answer to Scream” but Initiation doesn’t quite make the grade.

Martyrs Lane,2021,91,"                      While it does have its faults and imperfections, it is a satisfying addition to the ranks of cinematic ghost stories and holds appeal beyond simple jumps and scares.                  "
In the Shadows,2020,100,"                      A slow film for sure , but at 94 minutes it doesn't outstay its welcome either. And if you like your science fiction drama dystopian, it is very much worth a watch.                  "
The Last Laugh,2019,53,                      The Last Laugh tries its best to tell a sweet tale about growing old with dignity and never giving up on your true self. The film is a mild recommendation for the right audience.

Anna,2019,33,"                      Besson’s new film is an overly smug repackaging of his most acclaimed work, La Femme Nikita.                  "
The Oath,2018,62,                      Skims the surface of how divisive politics drives wedges between friends and family but tends to lean toward broad comedy to make its point rather than insight.                  
Nina,2018,29,"                      It's overlong and overwrought, but the character arches and slow burn may prove enough to keep some viewers enthralled.                  "

The Boat,2018,78,"                      The Boat isn't for everyone. It doesn't have any huge reveals, or ghastly spectral encounters. It's Christine without George Thorogood, The Shining if the only thing haunting Jack Torrance was the endless snow.                  "

Super 30,2019,31,"                      I wish I had strong emotions watching Super 30, a competently filmed entertainment but a frustrating embroidery of a story already inherent with cinematic value. It's well-intentioned and well-made but highly dubious.                  "

Perfect Nanny,2019,38,                      A discomfiting character study - and excellent vehicle for Viard - stuck with an ending it can't really handle.                  
The Wandering Earth,2019,70,                      It’s impossible not to mention the familiar tropes and second-hand characters. But this is science-fiction escapism at its very best.

Death on the Nile,2022,62,"                      Is there a point to re-adapting these already-familiar films and novels? Branagh doesn’t successfully answer that question, seemingly trading on that sense of familiarity to sell tickets to the remake.                  "

Devotion,2022,82,"                      The drama can get pretty heavy-handed and expose just how sanitized and corny Hollywood productions are compared to grittier indies, but the emotional impact at its back is undeniable.                  "
Promised Land,2017,77,                      The King is a vastly entertaining and at times uncomfortably intimate account of a life whose rise and tragic fall Jarecki asserts is a metaphor for a parallel demise of the American Empire.                  
October,2018,92,                      October is an aggressively weird film that would be considered ahead of its time even if it were released now.

Badhaai Ho,2018,92,                      Dialogue writer Ghildial coats a taboo topic in a veneer of humour. The screenplay builds in just the right amount of emotional nudges and Sharma's direction binds together all the elements to deliver a satisfying watch.

Pass Over,2018,93,"                      As a drama, Pass Over is a masterful tragedy. As a reflection of the world, it is all too real and utterly woeful.                  "
Hallowed Ground,2019,0,"                      Hallowed Ground is a massive disappointment. One can't quite figure out whether it genuinely is going for that campy B-movie vibe, but even that wouldn't excuse the terrible writing.                  "

Thackeray,2019,20,"                      Sadly there is very little focus on his children or even his impact as an artist. The timeline of Thackeray is conveniently engineered to delete the unflattering, the sensitive and the problematic mandate.                  "

In the Shadow of the Moon,2019,57,                      This sincere and intriguing mystery is a fine whodunit.                  
The Weekend,2018,87,                      Zamata is not only deadly with her precision-timed one-liners but piercing in the more dramatic beats.                  
The Bad Guys,2022,88,"                      …the notion of rejecting societal labelling and finding your own way through experience is thoughtfully developed here, and there’s enough humour to keep the kids engaged…                  "
Along With the Gods: The Last 49 Days,2018,44,                      There's a very operatic quality at play here. I don't necessarily mean that as a compliment.                  
High Flying Bird,2019,91,                      Easily the best film about sports since Moneyball and a complete slam dunk for Soderbergh who is having a much more significant and successful return from retirement than Michael Jordan!                  
When the Beat Drops,2018,83,                      Sims excels in showing the joy and ecstasy these men get from dancing.                  
Phobias,2021,57,                      The ambitious concept of the horror flick Phobias is so terribly mishandled that the end result is a movie that relies on boring and over-used clichés. The movie's tone and acting are uneven. The screenwriting is sloppy.                  
The Body,2019,14,                      It is disappointing that The Body isn't quite the film it could have been.                  
Badla,2019,63,                      Badla is a return to form for the acclaimed director of Kahaani who delivers another arresting mystery thriller involving missing bodies and murder.                  
Here We Are,2020,100,"                      In a rare mix of tones, 'Here We Are' brings us the seriousness of comedy, the harshness of humor, the gut-wrenching similarities of crying and laughing, and the contradictory takeaway, that pain heals us. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
The Harvesters,2018,92,"                      Vermeulen gives a belter of a performance, never overplaying Janno's inner turmoil. Everything he thinks and feels plays across his entire body, most notably in the film's most potent scene as he has a confrontation and connection with Pieter.                  "
Honey Boy,2019,95,"                      By the final frames of Honey Boy, it becomes achingly apparent that the film is at once a work of auto-fiction and confessional.                   "
Leprechaun Returns,2018,45,"                      If your thing is watching a bunch of random teenagers get stuck in a cabin and killed one at a time, there are far, far worse examples than this.                  "
Happy Death Day 2U,2019,71,                      Rothe is asked to go even further here in terms of balancing the horror and comedy elements. She’s still a lot of fun to watch and is more than able to do most of the heavy lifting.                  
Fireflies,2018,100,"                      Ramin's easily telegraphed relationship with Guillermo is not as illuminating as his kinship with a local hotel owner. Their solidarity, and the film's refreshingly irregular structure, make Fireflies worth catching.                  "
The Greenhouse,2021,80,                      I found myself exasperated by this film’s focus on atmosphere at the expense of developing characters and ideas so they deliver a satisfying emotional payoff.                  
Follow Me,2020,33,"                      Watchable, enjoyable, but also - it must be said - a little forgettable.                  "
Wine Country,2019,67,"                      It’s a real comfort-food movie, and that’s apparently all Poehler and her team wanted to make. Don’t they deserve to? Don’t we deserve to have one?                  "
John Henry,2020,0,                      I didn't make it all the way through it.                  
The Other Side of Heaven 2: Fire of Faith,2019,71,                      Sentimental biopic about LDS missionary's time in Tonga.                  
Body Cam,2020,44,"                      ... it raises more questions than answers, making for an unfulfilling experience, no matter how hard the cast and crew have tried to sell it.                  "
The Short History of the Long Road,2019,89,"                      When The Short History of the Long Road arrives at its final destination with a message about finding your own path, it sadly fails to land much of an emotional punch.                  "
Breaking Bread,2020,91,                      It's all shot very lovingly and you see all of the passion and the care that goes into these meals.                   
Jihad Jane,2019,91,                      Their own frank and fascinating first-person accounts in this documentary provide no simple answers about their online self-radicalization.

The Perfect Date,2019,67,                      This movie is perfect for fans of Noah Centineo who need something to tide them over till the To All the Boys I've Loved Before sequel arrives.                  
Bad Education,2019,94,"                      Frank Tassone isn’t a likeable character; in fact, he’s rather detestable. But that almost makes me love this film even more. It’s been a long journey towards real queer representation...                  "
Nana,2018,60,"                      Now more than ever we need films like Nana to remind us of what can happen when we let prejudice cloud judgment, and the amount of work that still has to be done to prevent that from happening in the future.                  "
The Furies,2019,67,                      Writer-director Tony D'Aquino's obvious love for the genre and sense of invention is contagious.                  
Papi Chulo,2018,75,"                      It should be satirical, but the film doesn't seem to be in on the joke... [Moments of vulnerability] are to be credited more to the cast's acting power than to the narrative.                  "
The Body Remembers When the World Broke Open,2019,97,"                      Inspired by a very real and transformative moment...

"
Knives and Skin,2019,70,"                      Knives and Skin tackles a number of heavy topics. There’s always a light at the end of the tunnel, no matter if things get dark in the midst of the film’s beautiful colour palette.                  "
The Report,2019,82,"                      The Report earns our admiration by relying on details to tell the story, and our understanding of their implications does the rest.                   "
The Shed,2019,59,"                      The teen-angst angle isn't explored nearly enough, making it hard to root for the young leads, but some of the bloodthirsty special effects are impressive.                  "
Marionette,2020,75,"                      “Marionette” takes quite a long time to do anything ingenious, but once it gets there, I was impressed with the unexpected turns the story took. If horror cliches make you feel safe and comforted, it’s worth your time.                  "
Goalie,2019,18,"                      Like all good sports movies Goalie isn't about scores or stats, it's about what drives the players to push themselves, to be warriors or be worthless.                  "

The Prey,2018,73,"                      An embarrassingly cliché action flick that has no memorable characters and an extremely derivative story ...

Fantastic Fungi,2019,100,"                      The biology is fascinating, but Schwartzberg's experts and enthusiasts are positively evangelical when it comes to the potential of fungi in medicine, pest-control, oil spill clean-ups and, of course, psychedelic experiences. It's all quite a trip.                  "
The Holiday Calendar,2018,33,"                      This movie is like a sugar cookie: you know exactly what you're getting, and it has all the right ingredients (love, magic, presents), but it would've been even better with a little frosting on top, is all.                  "
Love at Second Sight,2019,50,"                      Not only extensive -117 minutes- but, what's worse, it takes a long time. [Full review in Spanish]                  "

Dead Souls,2018,100,"                      Not a film for the faint of heart, but no other film this year felt more vital, immediate, or audacious, earning every minute of its gargantuan runtime.                  "
Blow the Man Down,2019,98,"                      It’s an original story, which is rare, that is different, and you find an appreciation will build as the quarantined days melt together.                  "

Divine Love,2019,85,"                      Maybe, the story spends too much time preaching, but Mascaro holds tight to his credo, aiming at the Brazilian conservatism with irony.                  "
Crshd,2019,75,"                      As writer/director/editor Emily Cohn handles the material with such panache, CRSHD is able to overcome the familiar beats one would expect in a comedy such as this.                  "
The Host,2020,25,"                      The movie has so much of Psycho in it, that it's a blatant homage or ripoff, depending on your perspective.                  "

Doom: Annihilation,2019,43,"                      If you want to kill some time you can have a laugh along with it, but regardless there is no point in this film having the Doom name attached, it does very little with the IP.                  "
The Golem,2018,86,"                      The Golem is a gorgeous movie that pays respect to it's roots while also updating the legend, quite terrifyingly, to be relevant with the times.

Flashback,2020,54,                      Flashback is a film that will require multiple viewings to make sense of. The problem is it is not engaging enough to merit revisiting.                  
Swallow,2019,87,                      Swallow has an uncommon raw power that most films can’t reach.                  
The Yellow Wallpaper,2021,67,"                      Stiflingly literal mounting of the classic feminist tale. Flat and stilted, with no cultural context and no visceral insight into its protagonists plight, and emptiness where there should be empathy.                  "
The Racer,2020,85,                      This is a sad film about the limits of the body and the rationalizations we can make when we sacrifice our integrity.                  
Queen of Hearts,2019,97,"                      This gripping erotic drama, directed by May el-Toukhy with wonderful performances from all, is sometimes in danger of slipping over into posh soap, or soft-core porn, territory                  "
Grand Isle,2019,9,"                      A decent movie that without being a standout, it accomplishes its objective. Nicolas Cage puts his token mad outbreaks to use in his role as a sometimes funny manic-depressive which makes this production extremely enjoyable. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
Mighty Oak,2020,60,"                      Mighty Oak is not reinventing the wheel nor is it a cinematic marvel, but, what Mighty Oak does right is present a good family movie, one that is easily accessible to all age ranges.                  "
Instinct,2019,80,"                      I can't say I want to see it again, but I really need to. More importantly, I really hope rapists end up seeing it. Just maybe they'll realize what they've done.                  "
Wildland,2020,93,                      An absorbing and often ominous experience...                  
Memoria,2021,90,"                      Apichatpong Weerasethakul’s Memoria is both romantic and hallucinatory, sumptuously presented and emotionally engaging piece of magical realism that explores and expands the limitations of human experience.                  "
Snake Eyes,2021,35,"                      It’s brought down by the story’s slow patches, the weird mystical goofiness, and the odd choice to leave G.I. Joe on the backburner. Snake-Eyes doesn’t even put on his signature mask and visor until the final scene.                  "
Spiral,2019,74,"                      A challenging and topical consideration of the queer experience, filtered through a racialized 90s lens. Bowyer-Chapman is great and while Spiral doesn't have the supportive gay relationship some viewers want, it's still valuable LGBT representation                  "
An Unexpected Love,2018,89,"                      A love story, real, open, with shades of comedy and life between its lines. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
Out in the Open,2019,80,                      It's a drama as regular as the desert dust. [Full review in Spanish]                  
Detention,2012,43,"                      Kahn exploits his music video expertise in this overwhelming, joke-a-minute genre explosion. Featuring cute as a button Josh Hutcherson, the editing alone guarantees this unconventional horror comedy won't be for everyone. If it is, though, it's A+                    "
The Projectionist,2019,92,"                      By the last act it feels like we're watching a local sales video for a small multiplex -- come on by, the popcorn's fine enough, we guess?                  "
One of These Days,2020,50,"                      Cole... shows his versatility with a tremendously credible performance as a sleepy-eyed, blue-­collar local, desperate to win the truck to improve the life of his young family.                  "
Body of Water,2020,92,"                      A grim film about family dysfunction, this is painful realism crafted with real but brutal care.                  "
Rams,2018,100,                      The biography portion of the doc is pretty standard; much more fun is to hear Rams hold forth on his philosophy of design.                  
The Wind,2018,81,                      It is really compelling.                  
Moynihan,2018,86,"                      It is unfortunate, then, that codirectors Joseph Dorman and Toby Perl Freilich deliver a staid yet informative rundown of Moynihan's political maneuvers.                  "
Shirley,2020,87,"                      Stuhlbarg, customarily an enjoyably eccentric performer, plays his line-readings mostly straight, and the two young ones they’re pitted against have even less to work with.                  "
Hidden Man,2018,67,"                      Long before a rushed finale concludes its unnecessary 134 minutes, you may find yourself engaged by its jokiness, admiring of its action and absolutely longing for the fun to end.                  "
Inside,2018,28,"                      [A]lthough Inside is very contrived and silly, it's also fun, entertaining, stylistically interesting and, at times, blackly comic                  "
Tulsa,2020,69,"                      The film stays in the simple, inspirational, hopeful lane, but who doesn't welcome a bit of that right now?                  "
Phoenix,2018,76,"                      Phoenix is shot in dark, restrained tones. It's unremittingly grim for the first half hour in its observation of the details of Jill's life.                  "
Hidden Away,2020,63,"                      Art awakens humanity, no less so in Giorgio Diritti's Hidden Away. His biopic of 20th century Italian painter Antonio Liguabue is a tender, impressionistic look at a man who overcame physical and psychiatric ailments.                  "
Black Beauty,2020,48,                      It felt so derivative of so many better films                  
The Room,2019,71,                      [Olga Kurylenko and Kevin Janssens] blend together seamlessly into a matchless framework on human nature. [Full review in Spanish]                  
Porno,2019,77,"                      Theater employees will get a charge from the on-sire locations and the accuracy of working at a cinema, and there is some decent sex and violence, but ultimately, 'Porno' is a trifle.                  "
Bad Therapy,2020,7,                      Bad Therapy is a dark comedy that is the film equivalent of a soft dim light.                  
Spare Parts,2020,75,                      It's a clumsy and clunky film that is biting off more than it can chew.                  
Hamilton,2020,98,                      The phenomena that's been the topic of conversation for the past few years is a must watch. Friendly reminder on why Lin Manuel Miranda is a genius.                   
Satanic Panic,2019,63,"                      A few years down the line, Chelsea Stardust’s feature directorial debut is still a lot of fun and cult mayhem with solid performances and some good blood.                  "
Happiest Season,2020,82,"                      By leaning on a rather trite “coming out” story, the otherwise hilarious movie fails to live up to its obvious potential.                  "
Othello,2014,68,                      Laurence Fishburne does one helluva job portraying the famous Moor straight out of the pages of Shakespeare.                  
The Way Back,2020,84,"                      Drawing on his own past experiences, it is one of his best on-screen performances in a long time. Affleck is the film’s MVP but [the film] falls short of the stuff hoop dreams are made of.                  "
Prey,2018,13,"                      Prey might've been forgivable if it dived headfirst into its sense of ridiculousness, but it's ultimately too boring to even be so-bad-it's-good.                  "
Pleasure,2021,88,"                      After a while the shock value wears off... The pall of nauseous discomfort that hovers over the whole enterprise, though, sticks.                  "
Aurora,2019,100,"                      Not many original parts here, but it's a charming vehicle nonetheless.                  "
Robin Hood,2017,15,"                      All style, no substance, and yet another film at the end begging for a sequel in its final scene.                  "
IRL,2019,100,"                      An intelligent, intuitive, achingly vulnerable, and remarkably human motion picture that soars almost precisely because it doesn't soar.                  "
Crypto,2019,17,                      Slow cryptocurrency crime-drama has some graphic violence.                  
Happy Times,2019,73,"                      Very entertaining, with insult-laden dialogue and plenty of creative violence and tension.                  "
1917,2019,89,                      A technical marvel to behold that puts you right in the heart of war but ultimately leaves you emotionally cold to the resultant horror and heroics of the men involved.                  
Ghost Fleet,2018,64,"                      [W]hile Ghost Fleet brings a massive issue to the forefront, it does a lackluster job at establishing and blending its economic, cultural, and social implications.                  "
Into the Labyrinth,2019,40,"                      With a noir-style script and stylised visuals, the film catches the interest from the start.                  "
Portrait of a Lady on Fire,2019,97,"                      Every artist begins with a blank canvas. It is what they do with it that defines them. With Portrait Of A Lady On Fire, Céline Sciamma has painted her masterpiece.                  "
Last Christmas,2019,46,"                      I now finally have my own The Brown Bunny. I hated Last Christmas. The lazy, peculiar, and out of left field twist has no justification. It simply doesn’t work.                  "
Run,2020,89,"                      Run is a riveting rollercoaster ride from start to finish, pairing a pulse-pounding plot with powerhouse performances from Sarah Paulson and Kiera Allen.                  "
The Farewell,2019,97,                      An opening title card tells us this is a film “Based on an actual lie.” Funny thing is “The Farewell” is one of the truest movies about illness and grief I’ve seen in a while.                   
The East,2020,73,"                      ""The East"" doesn't do much different when telling the story of the Indonesian War of Independence, but it does bring a new subject matter to viewers' attention that continues to show the painful side of war.                   "
Voices,2020,0,"                      The bare bones of Voices should work - they just don't. Instead, what viewers are left with is a lumbering, haphazard, uninteresting mess of a film that's far better left unseen.                  "
Buffaloed,2019,81,"                      It’s rare for a film to feature a female lead brimming with temerity that’s full of so much piss and vinegar you may be afraid she will spin off her own axis. Buffaloed has it here with Deutch, who gives a career-best performance.                  "
Vai,2019,100,                      Vai captures the multifaceted experience of being a Pasifika (Pacific Islander) woman while maintaining a dexterous continuity of style and mood.                  
Corpus Christi,2019,98,"                      We might be in for a sappy redemption story, but this has darker twists to come.                  "
Waves,2019,84,"                      Some second half plotting keeps “Waves” from being a truly great film, but Shults has once again shown himself to be a shrewd and audacious storyteller.                  "
Flawless,2018,67,                      Flawless is a take on the coming of age story that is refreshingly new even as it demonstrates typical machinations within the genre.                  
Redemption,2018,100,                      A familiar story affectingly told through an unusual prism.                  
Joan of Arc,2019,57,"                      If [Bruno] Dumont's feminist aims weren't clear before, Joan's resistance to doubt and intimidation makes her the most powerful figure in the film, even as that power gets turned against her.                  "
The Circle,2016,15,"                      Regardless of what it teases, “The Circle” doesn’t really go anywhere and that may be its biggest flaw – lots of potential, practically all of it wasted.                  "
To the Ends of the Earth,2019,93,"                      I was often mildly bored while watching Kiyoshi Kurosawa’s To the Ends of the Earth, but it’s sat well since.                  "
21 Bridges,2019,54,"                      Predictable, yet some times extremely entertaining and fun. Boseman creates a cool stereotypical cop hero in a movie that doesn't add much to the genre, but at least does not subtracts from it. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
Breaking the Waves,2014,85,"                      Emily Watson gives this musty spiritualism a flesh and-blood sympathetic center. Her purity of emotion, be it bliss, fear or sorrow, are convincingly unactorly and the camera -- even Von Trier's handheld pseudo-documentary one -- loves her face.                  "
Our Lady of the Nile,2019,100,"                      Our Lady of the Nile is ultimately about how the sad legacy of how hate can easily be passed from one generation to the next, but also how hard it is to escape inevitable violence.                  "
Boris Karloff: The Man Behind the Monster,2021,96,"                      As you might suspect, watching Boris Karloff: The Man Behind the Monster will inspire a very strong urge to watch as many Karloff films as possible...                  "
Cusp,2021,86,"                      As heavy as Cusp mostly is, the main subjects emerge on the other side of their bad experiences, and its actually remarkable seeing them changenot just physically but emotionally as wellbefore our eyes.                  "
Blackbird,2019,63,                      Blackbird is the equivalent of running a story about euthanasia through an airbrushing app.                  
Proximity,2020,38,"                      His directorial debut might star the beardy prophet, but the saviour of cinema Eric Demeusy is not...                  "
Mob Town,2019,0,"                      Mobtown lives in a space of mediocrity, never too horrible or uninteresting to turn off and never good enough for you to be happy to be watching.                  "
Circus of Books,2019,98,"                      Circus Of Books is a spellbinding portrait of two unlikely Queer allies, charting their personal journeys with a community that would become central to their lives.                  "
Rams,2020,91,"                      A bit all over the place, introducing characters and possible story threads that it abandons...But the leads and the lovely scenery make up for some of that.                  "
The Dog Doc,2019,86,"                      The film seems intent on painting vaccines as a major bugbear, returning to the topic over and over in order to blame vaccinations for animals' suffering.                  "
See You Yesterday,2019,93,                      A very different blend [of genres]... I think for the most part it's unsuccessful.                  
The Swimmers,2022,79,                      A well-rounded movie that is satisfactory. [Full review in Spanish]                  
Marmaduke,2022,0,"                      Just a bad movie, in such a way I can barely even remember what the jokes were supposed to be.                  "
Sergio,2020,44,"                      We end up with an almost saintly portrait that glosses over milestones, mostly skips internal conflicts, and favors a passionate yet overcooked romance.                  "
Palm Beach,2019,46,"                      Yes, it's a film that celebrates privilege, and yes, it's an exceptionally white film, but Palm Beach is a film that delivers for the market that is craving this kind of material.                  "
The Island,2018,100,"                      This Chinese disaster movie is polished with snazzy special effects and an eclectic soundtrack, but may puzzle American audiences with its cultural differences.                  "
Selah and the Spades,2019,86,                      Poe’s debut feature is a highly stylized and engaging Juvenalian satire about today’s political climate that plays it too safe with its finale.                  
Apollo 11,2019,99,"                      All in all, Apollo 11 lasted about eight days from launch to splashdown, and Miller condenses that down to the most interesting 93 minutes. The footage presented on screen is stirring and emotive.                  "
Exit Plan,2019,41,"                      Exit Plan perfectly balances the suspense of a thriller while asking deep questions about how we die. If the topics are not too heavy, Exit Plan is enjoyable and thought-provoking.                  "
The Tomorrow Man,2019,42,"                      The Tomorrow Man celebrates those in their elder years, who can and do still live full and meaningful lives in so many ways...                  "
Midsommar,2019,83,                      I did not like MidSommar as much as I appreciated its audacity and the skill that clearly went into making it. This was a stunning work of art that embraced excess with a few positive results.                  
Freaks,2018,88,"                      A surprising and refreshing riff on ""gifted child"" flicks like Firestarter or The Fury.                  "
Consequences,2018,76,                      The grounded nature of the film helps to establish the connections between the characters.                  
Evelyn,2018,100,"                      I was deeply moved by the simplicity of this gentle film and the courage it took to make it. It drew out my compassion for those who consider suicide as their only option, as well as the loved ones left behind.                  "
Fausto,2018,100,"                      For hard-core cinephiles with the patience to journey through a 16mm long take hypnotic universe, and not for those looking for a less experimental, narrative experience. [Full review in Spanish]                  "
American Dharma,2018,62,                      Morris essentially provides this scandalmonger and inciter of racial and ethnic hatred a platform for most of the one and a half hours of the film.                  
10 Minutes Gone,2019,0,                      Works through as many cliches as possible in 90 minutes.                  
The Obituary of Tunde Johnson,2019,89,                      The Obituary of Tunde Johnson is a provocative film that only gets better with each viewing.                  
Come to Daddy,2019,87,                      The most terrifying thing called Come To Daddy to appear on screen since the Aphex Twin video!                  
Buddy,2018,96,"                      A genuinely fresh take on ""dog films"" that, thanks to both the doc's dutiful furry stars and their grateful human co-stars, amounts to solid entertainment for all ages and screens.                  "
I Will Make You Mine,2020,100,"                      I Will Make You Mine acts as a bittersweet treatise on longing, closure, and roads not taken.                  "
Unraveled,2007,67,"                      Unraveled is compelling, dramatic, at times even poignant, and as you await the final sentencing order along with Marc Drier, you too, will find yourself on the edge of your seat.                  "
Faith,2019,100,"                      Pedicini structures the movie as an oblique narrative rather than an exposé. And ""Faith"" is all the more disturbing for that.                  "
Gay Chorus Deep South,2019,100,"                      With the aftermath of the election still upon us, the film renews our hope in the future, and helps get rid of the nasty aftertaste of the falls bitter political contest.                  "
Belmonte,2018,87,"                      The resolution is thoroughly unearned (the cinematic equivalent of ""sleeping on it""), which at 75 minutes-length feels straight-up lazy.                  "

Recorder: The Marion Stokes Project,2019,95,"                      It is, of course, of immense archival value, but the effect of the sheer weight of such a vast store of media, layered upon itself like an enormous cake of pure information, is far more metaphysical than mere archival utility.                  "

Stowaway,2021,76,                      {Stowaway} completely mishandles any chance of a morality play by playing it too safe. It’s such a flat experience that it made me ponder whether the world is round after all.                  
Angelfish,2019,86,"                      [Peter Andrew Lee's] performers are up to the task, particularly [Destiny Nicole] Frasqueri, whose gentle, understated performance stands in opposition to her extroverted hip-hop image.                  "

Cinderella,2021,42,                      It’s a musical without good songs. It’s a comedy that isn’t funny. It’s a romance that lacks spark. The biggest casualty is Cabello who has some noticeable charm and even a little swagger.                  
The Girl on the Train,2021,9,"                      Ultimately, this movie was more frustrating than bad. And it ended up leaving me with a total apathy about what happens in a murder-mystery movie, which is a complete failure of the movie itself.                  "

Body Parts,2022,100,"                      At times, BODY PARTS feels almost too ambitious, tackling so many components that it lacks a tight narrative focus. Yet much of this is fascinating, so much that viewers might wish the film had explored some vignettes longer.                   "
Crip Camp,2020,100,"                      Crip Camp provides an inside view of the importance of freedom, expression, youth, pleasure and life. Things we often take for granted. Their fight paved the way for a better life. Incredible documentary. [Full review in Spanish]                  "

Knives Out,2019,97,"                      Not only is Johnson enjoying himself, but the entire cast is clearly having a blast. And how could they not? Johnson creates for them a narrative playground full of whip-smart dialogue, genre nostalgia, and with a biting sense of humor.                  "
Into the Darkness,2020,61,"                      There's a great range of narrative in this movie, but the ending is lopped off to the point where I don't think there will be anyone who isn't confused by it.                  "

Exile,2020,91,"                      A ""thriller"" in much the same low-key workplace nightmare way that last year's The Assistant was, this is a very discomfiting film made no less so by the fact that our beleaguered protagonist isn't always a particularly sympathetic figure.                  "
Warning,2021,30,"                      Warning is full of sci-fi conclusions that genre fans already know, and the film's title says it all.                  "
Rojo,2018,96,"                      The movie's eerie, ominous atmosphere is legitimate, but can't substitute itself for historical concreteness.                  "
Shortcut,2020,59,"                      Shot in Italy, with an English cast, there's a crisp, almost fairytale levity to Alessio Liguori's horror adventure that sits oddly but not unworkably with its gorier elements.                  "
The Magic Life of V,2019,73,"                      Veera is a sympathetic and engaging figure, but the film is missing something. Dwelling on shallow drama, we learn little of what it means to cope.                  "
The Biggest Little Farm,2018,91,"                      Deep pockets and big dreams aside, this is an aspirational film fuelled with a positive energy that is infectious.                  "

Goodnight Mommy,2022,40,                      A sort of Disney-esque interpretation of the forceful original movie that dilates between melodramas and half measures the intense tour the force that we were able to enjoy in 2014.                  
The Assistant,2019,93,                      Writer-director Kitty Green expertly crafts a culture of fear that permeates every inch of the frame... and holds up a damning mirror to the film industry in this impressive and incendiary feature.

Clean Up,2018,100,"                      It's an incredibly slow burn that wobbles at its most stagnant parts, but its attention to detail make for a picture that orders viewers to reprocess itself as it unfolds.                  "
Bliss,2019,87,"                      Wilson is amiably befuddled, and even if Bliss doesn't wholly deliver, its sheer creative energy is, in itself, invigorating.                  "
In Between,2017,98,"                      What seems like a film of air-punching optimism actually takes a much sadder turn later. But in choosing to take a realist approach to its final act, the director has made a much better film for it.                  "

The King,2018,77,                      The King is a vastly entertaining and at times uncomfortably intimate account of a life whose rise and tragic fall Jarecki asserts is a metaphor for a parallel demise of the American Empire.                  
Father,2020,100,                      Nikola’s unwavering determination in the face of callous dismissal should inspire all of us to redouble our efforts to advance righteous causes.

Blank,2019,0,                      The film is let down by a storyline that strains credulity.                  
Perdida,2019,20,"                      No mystery thriller you can figure out before the midway point can claim total success, no action pic that saves the heroine from certain death with the devices this one uses can cling to believability.                  "
Perfect 10,2019,100,"                      Perfect 10 explores gritty, uncomfortable questions with a light hand, showing the people rather the predicament. Its a great example of what happens when different voices are heard, behind and in front of the camera.                  "
Dark Waters,2019,89,                      Dark Waters is ultimately a paean to tenacity. It argues that heroism is not merely a moment when one person rises up to do the right thing. It's the ability to stick to your values over a long period of time.                  
Relic,2020,92,                      This is a horror that is refreshingly unreliant on jump scares. Eschewing them in favour of building mood and atmosphere.

Irresistible,2020,40,                      The entire purpose of Jon Stewart’s Irresistible seems to be an exercise on how both sides can p*ss into the wind without getting their pants wet.                  
Three Husbands,2018,40,                      Three Husbands comes across as an angry rant with no ostensible focus.                  
Last Letter,2018,78,                      Last Letter's quaint premise belies the many layers waiting to be peeled away.                  
City under the Sea,2014,40,"                      It's one of the blander of these fantasy forays, perhaps due in part to the minimum of action and monsters.                  "
Initials SG,2019,100,"                      Despite there being a bit too many endings, Initials S.G. is still a worthy genre distorter that attempts to surprise you at every turn.                  "
Cold Blood,2019,0,                      It's not much of a mystery and it's not particularly thrilling.                  
Coldplay: A Head Full of Dreams,2018,50,"                      A Head Full of Dreams essentially amounts to a two-hour commercial for Coldplay, with its faint traces of grit buried beneath mountains of rainbow-coloured confetti.                  "
The Rescue,2021,96,"                      The Rescue is a thrilling testament to the power of the human spirit. One that, just like the divers, will have audiences holding their breath till they reach the other side.                  "
After Parkland,2019,100,                      After Parkland is a rallying cry for those who want to do something about preventing more of these tragedies from happening.                  
Our Time Machine,2019,100,"                      It's a sweet doc, one that neither over-extends itself nor gins up daily conflicts into climactic moments.                  "
Notebook,2019,22,"                      Cinematographer Manoj Kumar Khatoi's camerawork captures lush, stunning Kashmiri vistas... but it cannot pull Notebook out of the senseless narrative swamp that it wades through.                  "
Emma,2019,86,                      Austen is as compelling as ever.                  
American Woman,2019,57,"                      American Woman is a movie that values words. Some may find the storytelling a bit too low key for such an explosive subject, but the performances, particularly Chau, give the story layers.                  "
Wrong Turn,2021,65,"                      Having no allusions about Wrong Turn's prospects, my low expectations were surpassed.                  "
Ice on Fire,2019,91,"                      In Mother Earth's respectably long history we are mere late arrivals, [thus] the arrogance of our ilk in assuming the place is now all ours to refurbish, truly beggars belief.                  "
Never Too Late,2020,46,"                      Goes through the motions with familiar jokes about getting older, when something more moving could have been done. A waste of a great cast.                   "
The Eyes of Tammy Faye,2021,68,"                      The whole film seemed engineered to get her [Jessica Chastain] that little gold man, and her performance was often most noteworthy for the sheer level of transformation involved.                   "
Trail of Ashes,2020,40,"                      It's a shame that the writing falls short since there was some real promise to what this film could be. It's not horrendously bad by any means, but there's a lot of room for improvement.                  "
Alice,2019,90,"                      Alice rejects convention and may just find joy, even if it means going nuclear. Breathtaking.                  "
